# .NET for UWP apps
[!INCLUDE[net_win10_profile](../net-uwp/includes/net-win10-profile-md.md)] provides a set of managed types that you can use to create [!INCLUDE[win10_uwp_long](../net-uwp/includes/win10-uwp-long-md.md)] apps for Windows 10 using C# or Visual Basic. The following list displays the namespaces in [!INCLUDE[net_win10_profile](../net-uwp/includes/net-win10-profile-md.md)]. Note that [!INCLUDE[net_win10_profile](../net-uwp/includes/net-win10-profile-md.md)] includes a subset of the types provided in the full .NET Framework for each namespace. For information about individual namespaces, see the linked topics.  
  
 For more information, see the [.NET for Windows Store apps overview](../Topic/.NET%20for%20Windows%20Store%20apps%20overview.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[win10_uwp](../net-uwp/includes/win10-uwp-md.md)] only: APIs for [!INCLUDE[win10_uwp](../net-uwp/includes/win10-uwp-md.md)] apps that are expressed as HTML or XAML elements are supported only in [!INCLUDE[win10_uwp](../net-uwp/includes/win10-uwp-md.md)] apps; they are not supported in desktop apps or Windows desktop browsers.
