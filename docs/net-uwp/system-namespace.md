# System namespace
The `System` namespace contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and processing exceptions.  
  
 This topic displays the types in the `System` namespace that are included in the [!INCLUDE[net_win8_profile](../net-uwp/includes/net-win8-profile-md.md)]. Note that the [!INCLUDE[net_win8_profile](../net-uwp/includes/net-win8-profile-md.md)] does not include all the members of each type. For information about individual types, see the linked topics. The documentation for a type indicates which members are included in the [!INCLUDE[net_win8_profile](../net-uwp/includes/net-win8-profile-md.md)].
