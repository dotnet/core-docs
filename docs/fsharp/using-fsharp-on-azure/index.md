# Using F# on Azure

F# is a superb language for cloud programming and is frequently used to write web applications, cloud services, cloud-hosted microservices, and for scalable data processing.

In the sections below, you will find resources on how to use a range of Azure services with F#.

> Note: If a particular Azure service doesn't have documentation below, please consult the C# documentation for that service. Some
> Azure services are entirely language-independent systems services and require no language-specific documentation, and in this
> case are not listed here.
