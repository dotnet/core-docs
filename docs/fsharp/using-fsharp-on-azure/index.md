# Using F# on Azure

F# is a superb language for cloud programming and is frequently used to write web applications, cloud services, cloud-hosted microservices, and for scalable data processing.

In the sections below, you will find resources on how to use a range of Azure services with F#.

> [!NOTE]
> If a particular Azure service isn't in this documentation set, please consult the C# documentation for that service. Some Azure services are entirely language-independent systems services and require no language-specific documentation, and in this case are not listed here.
