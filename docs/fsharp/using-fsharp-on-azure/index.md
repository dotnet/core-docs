# Using F# on Azure

F# is a superb language for cloud programming and is frequently used to write web applications, cloud services, cloud-hosted microservices, and for scalable data processing.

In the sections below, you will find resources on how to use a range of Azure services with F#.

> [!NOTE]
> If a particular Azure service isn't in this documentation set, please consult the C# documentation for that service. Some Azure services are entirely language-independent systems services and require no language-specific documentation, and in this case are not listed here.

## Using Azure Virtual Machines with F# #

Azure supports a wide range of virtual machine (VM) configurations, see [Linux and Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/)

To install F# on a virtual machine for execution, compilation and/or scripting see [Using F# on Linux](http://fsharp.org/use/linux) and
[Using F# on Windows](http://fsharp.org/use/windows).

## Using Azure Storage with F# #

Azure Storage is a base layer of storage services for modern applications that rely on durability, availability, and scalability to meet the needs of customers. F# programs can interact directy with Azure storage services, using the techinques described in the articles below.
