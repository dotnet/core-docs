# F# Guide

F# is a functional programming language which runs on .NET.  In addition to supporting functional programming constructs, it also has object programming capabilities.  This hybrid of functional programming with object-oriented capabilities makes F# a pragmatic language for accomplishing any task.

## If You're New to F# #

If you're new to F#, begin with the [Tour of F#](tour.md) to get an overview of the language and some of its programming concepts.  If you're using Visual Studio, the Tutorial project template contains the same content.

## If You're Experienced with F# #

If you know your way around F#, or want to learn more about a specific language construct, see the [Language Reference](language-reference/index.md).  It's a thorough guide of all F# language capabilities.

Additionally, the [F# Core Library Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/visualfsharpdocs/conceptual/fsharp-core-library-reference) is a great resource for learning about FSharp.Core, the core library which is a part of F#.

## The F# Software Foundation

Although Microsoft is the primary developer of the F# language and its tooling, F# is also backed by an independent foundation, the F# Software Foundation (FSSF).

The mission of the F# Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the F# programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of F# programmers.
