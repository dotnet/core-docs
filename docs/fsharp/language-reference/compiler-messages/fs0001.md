# FS0001: Error from adding type equation

This error is given when a value is determined to have a type that doesn't unify with a type that has been expected.

The following code demonstrates the error:

[!code-fsharp[FS0001](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0001.fs)]

This code results in the following output:

```
error FS0001: This expression was expected to have type
    'bool'
but here has type
    'int'
```

Here, the type of the `booleanBinding` is required to be `bool` by the type annotation. However the value `10` is inferred to be `int`. Because `int` is not the same as `bool`, this error is reported.

To solve this error, the programmer must change one of the two parts of the binding: the type annotation or the value binding.  

- If the value is correct, change or remove the type annotation. 

- If the type annotation is correct, check the value bound and ensure that no logic errors have been made.
