# ^ Operator (C# Reference)
Binary `^` operators are predefined for the integral types and `bool`. For integral types, `^` computes the bitwise exclusive-OR of its operands. For `bool` operands, `^` computes the logical exclusive-or of its operands; that is, the result is `true` if and only if exactly one of its operands is `true`.  
  
## Remarks  
 User-defined types can overload the `^` operator (see [operator](../keywords/operator--csharp-reference-2.md)). Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.  
  
## Example  
 [!code[csRefOperators#30](../operators/codesnippet/CSharp/^-operator--csharp-reference-_1.cs)]  
  
 The computation of `0xf8 ^ 0x3f` in the previous example performs a bitwise exclusive-OR of the following two binary values, which correspond to the hexadecimal values F8 and 3F:  
  
 `1111 1000`  
  
 `0011 1111`  
  
 The result of the exclusive-OR is `1100 0111`, which is C7 in hexadecimal.
