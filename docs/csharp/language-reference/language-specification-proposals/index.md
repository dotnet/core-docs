# C# language specification and proposals

The C# language specification is the definitive source for C# syntax and usage. This specification contains detailed information about all aspects of the language, including many points that the documentation for C# doesn't cover.

Version 5.0 of the specification has been released in December 2017 as the [Standard ECMA-334 5th Edition](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-334.pdf) document.

Version 6.0 of the specification has not been approved as a standard. This site contains the [*draft* C# 6.0 specification](../../../../_csharplang/spec/introduction.md). It's built from the markdown files contained in the [dotnet/csharplang GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/README.md).

The specifications for features added in versions following C# 6.0 have been published here in draft form. The specifications are arranged by version and feature. The links on the left point to each specification.

Issues on the draft specification should be created in the [dotnet/csharplang](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues) repository. Or, if you are interested
in fixing any errors you find, you may submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/pulls) to the same repository.
