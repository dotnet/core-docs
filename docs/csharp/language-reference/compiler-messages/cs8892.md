# Compiler warning (level 5) CS8892

Program has more than one entry point defined.
  
This warning is generated when you have multiple valid entry points, where they contain both synchronous and asynchronous ones. If the multiple entry points are all synchronous or all asynchronous, you get a compile error instead.

Because async main was only supported starting with C# 7.1, this warning doesn't produce for projects targeting a previous version. 

## Example

The following examples generates CS8892:
  
```csharp  
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1);
    }

    public static void Main(string[] a)
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(2);
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> This warning is only generated starting with the compiler that supported C# 9.0.
