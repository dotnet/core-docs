# Compiler warning (level 5) CS8892

Method 'method' will not be used as an entry point because a synchronous entry point 'method' was found.

This warning is generated when you have multiple valid entry points, where they contain one synchronous entry point and one or more asynchronous entry points. All other cases of multiple entry points will generate an error instead of a warning.

Because async main was only supported starting with C# 7.1, this warning doesn't produce for projects targeting a previous version.

## Example

The following examples generates CS8892:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Program
{
    // CS8892: Method 'Program.Main()' will not be used as an entry point because a synchronous entry point 'Program.Main(string[])' was found.
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1);
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(2);
    }
}
```

## How to fix this warning

Keep only the intended entry point for your program, and rename the others.

> [!NOTE]
> This warning is only generated starting with the compiler that supported C# 9.0.
