# Features at a glance

## Unified Type System

C# leverages the .NET Unified Type System. All C# types ultimately derive from `object`
(which is a C# shorthand for `System.Object`.) This provides a consistent experience
working with any types, including simple types, .NET Framework types, and user defined
types.

In addition, C# supports user defined reference and value types. Developers can
determine which is best for each particular use. 

## Expressiveness

## Object Oriented Roots

## Functional Programming Idioms

## Language Integrated Query (LINQ)

## Compiler Platform SDK
