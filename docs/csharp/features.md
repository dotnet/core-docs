# Features at a glance

The opening sentence of the C# Specification states:

> C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.

C# has grown since that was written, but it is still true to its roots. C# is still a simple,
modern, and type-safe language. It's now more multi-paradigm after adding more and more support
for functional concepts. It is still an expressive, and productive language to program with.

## Unified Type System

C# leverages the .NET Unified Type System. All C# types ultimately derive from `object`
(which is a C# shorthand for `System.Object`.) This provides a consistent experience
working with any types, including simple types, .NET Framework types, and user defined
types.

In addition, C# supports user defined reference and value types. Developers can
determine which is best for each particular use. 

## Expressiveness

## Object Oriented Roots

## Functional Programming Idioms

## Language Integrated Query (LINQ)

## Compiler Platform SDK
