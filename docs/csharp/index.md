# C# Guide

The opening sentence of the C# Specification states:

> C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.

C# has grown since that was written, but it is still true to its roots.
C# is still a simple, modern, and type-safe language. It's now more
multi-paradigm after adding more and more support for functional concepts.
It is still an expressive, and productive general purpose programming
language.

The C# Guide has content for experienced C# developers that want to learn
more, experienced developers that are new to C#, and people learning to
program. The three recommendations below can help you find the content you
need. Most people won't fit one of these profiles exactly. But, they
can still help you decide which sections will best help you.
