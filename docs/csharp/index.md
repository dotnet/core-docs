# C# Guide

The C# guide provides a wealth of information about the C# language. This site has many different audiences. Depending on your experience with programming, or with the C# language and .NET, you may wish to explore different sections of this guide.

## For new developers

Start with our [tutorials](tutorials/index) section. These tutorials show you how to create C# programs from scratch. The tutorials provide a step-by-step process to create programs. You'll learn the language concepts, and how to build C# programs on your own.
