# Tutorial: Annotate generic APIs to communicate nullability constraints

Generic APIs create unique challenges to express nullability constraints on type parameters. A well designed class may have APIs where arguments and returned values must not be null. Other APIs may allow null. There are attributes and constraints to express this behavior at a granular level.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * stuff
> * more stuff
> * and so on

## Prerequisites

You'll need to set up your machine to run .NET Core, including the C# 8.0 beta compiler. The C# 8 beta compiler is available with [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link&utm_content=download+vs2019), or the latest [.NET Core 3.0 preview](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).

This tutorial assumes you're familiar with C# and .NET, including either Visual Studio or the .NET Core CLI.

## Introduction

TODO: More detail here. Why T? doesn't work, fully annotate APIs. 

## Apply constaints to type parameters

Where `notnull` is discussed.

## Express constraints on arguments

## Basic constraints on return values

## Conditional constraints on return values

## Conditional constraints on string return values

## Conclusions
