# C# Tutorials

Welcome to the C# tutorials. These start with interactive lessons that you can run in your browser. Later tutorials and more advanced tutorials help you work with the .NET development tools to create C# programs on your machine.

## Explore new features in C\#

* [String Interpolation](string-interpolation.md): demonstrates how to use string interpolation to create formatted strings in C#.
* [Nullable reference types](nullable-reference-types.md): demonstrates how to use nullable reference types to express your intent for null references.
* [Update a project to make use of Nullable reference types](upgrade-to-nullable-references.md): demonstrates techniques to upgrade an existing project to make use of nullable reference types.
* [Extend data capabilities using pattern matching](pattern-matching.md): demonstrates how to use pattern matching to extend types beyond their core features.
* [Work with data sequences using indexes and ranges](ranges-indexes.md): Demonstrates new convenient syntax for accessing single elements or ranges of a sequential data container.

## General Tutorials

The following tutorials enable you to build C# programs using [.NET Core](../../core/introduction.md):

* [Console Application](console-teleprompter.md): demonstrates Console I/O, the structure of a Console application, and the basics of the task-based asynchronous programming model.
* [REST Client](console-webapiclient.md): demonstrates web communications, JSON serialization, and object-oriented features in the C# language.
* [Inheritance in C# and .NET](inheritance.md): demonstrates inheritance in C#, including the use of inheritance to define base classes, abstract base classes, and derived classes.
* [Working with LINQ](working-with-linq.md): demonstrates many of the features of LINQ and the language elements that support it.
* [Using Attributes](attributes.md): demonstrates how to create and use attributes in C#.
* [String interpolation](exploration/interpolated-strings.yml) tutorial shows you how to insert values into a string. You'll learn how to create an interpolated string with embedded C# expressions and how to control the text appearance of the expression results in the result string. This tutorial is also available [to run locally on your machine](exploration/interpolated-strings-local.md).
