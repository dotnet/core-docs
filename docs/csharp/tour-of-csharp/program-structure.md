# Program Structure

The key organizational concepts in C# are ***programs***, ***namespaces***, ***types***, ***members***, and ***assemblies***. C# programs consist of one or more source files. Programs declare types, which contain members and can be organized into namespaces. Classes and interfaces are examples of types. Fields, methods, properties, and events are examples of members. When C# programs are compiled, they're physically packaged into assemblies. Assemblies typically have the file extension `.exe` or `.dll`, depending on whether they implement ***applications*** or ***libraries***, respectively.

You can create a library project named *acme* using the `dotnet new` command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new classlib -o acme
```

In that project, declare a class named `Stack` in a namespace called `Acme.Collections`:

[!code-csharp[Stack](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/program-structure/program.cs#L1-L34)]

The fully qualified name of this class is `Acme.Collections.Stack`. The class contains several members: a field named `top`, two methods named `Push` and `Pop`, and a nested class named `Entry`. The `Entry` class further contains three members: a field named `next`, a field named `data`, and a constructor. The command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet build
```

compiles the example as a library (code without a `Main` entry point) and produces an assembly named `acme.dll`.

Assemblies contain executable code in the form of Intermediate Language (IL) instructions, and symbolic information in the form of metadata. Before it's executed, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler of .NET Common Language Runtime converts the IL code in an assembly to processor-specific code.

Because an assembly is a self-describing unit of functionality containing both code and metadata, there's no need for `#include` directives and header files in C#. The public types and members contained in a particular assembly are made available in a C# program simply by referencing that assembly when compiling the program. For example, this program uses the `Acme.Collections.Stack` class from the `acme.dll` assembly:

[!code-csharp[UsingStack](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/program-structure/Program.cs#L38-L52)]

The *csproj* file for the preceding program's project must include a reference node for the C# compiler to resolve references to the classes in the `acme.dll` assembly:

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\acme\acme.csproj" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

After that addition, `dotnet build` creates an executable assembly named `example.exe`, which, when run, produces the output:

```dotnetcli
100
10
1
```

C# permits the source text of a program to be stored in several source files. When a multi-file C# program is compiled, all of the source files are processed together, and the source files can freely reference each otherâ€”conceptually, it is as if all the source files were concatenated into one large file before being processed. Forward declarations are never needed in C# because, with few exceptions, declaration order is insignificant. C# does not limit a source file to declaring only one public type nor does it require the name of the source file to match a type declared in the source file.
