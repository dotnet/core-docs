# Quick starts

Welcome to the C# Quick starts. These start with interactive lessons
that you can run in your browser. As you get more experience, the later
quick starts run on your local machine creating larger C# programs.
In these lessons, you'll explore the C# language.

The first lessons explain C# concepts using small snippets of code. You'll
learn the basics of C# syntax and how to work with data types like strings,
numbers, and booleans. It's all interactive, and you'll be writing code

programming or the C# language.
