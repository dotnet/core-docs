    This tutorial teaches you about the number types in C# interactively, using your browser to write C# and see the results of compiling and running your code. It contains a series of lessons that explore numbers and math operations in C#. These lessons teach you the fundamentals of the C# language.

    Run the following code in the interactive window. To do that, type the following lines in the window on the right and click the 'Run' button:

    ```csharp
    int a = 18;
    int b = 6;
    int c = a + b;
    Console.WriteLine(c);
    ```

    You've just seen one of the fundamental math operations with integers. The `int` type represents an **integer**, a positive or negative whole number. You use the `+` symbol for addition. Other common mathematical operations for integers include:

    - `-` for subtraction
    - `*` for multiplication
    - `/` for division.

    > [!TIP]
    > Throughout this tutorial, you can explore on your own by modifying the code you've written in the interactive window. This tutorial provides examples that you can try at each step.

    Start by exploring those different operations. Modify the third line to try each of these operations. After each edit, click the 'Run' button.

    Subtraction:

    ```csharp
    int c = a - b;
    ```

    Multiplication:

    ```csharp
    int c = a * b;
    ```

    Division: 

    ```csharp
    int c = a / b;
    ```
    
    You can also experiment by performing multiple mathematics operations in the same line, if you'd like.

- title: Exploring order of operations
  durationInMinutes: 3
  content: |
    The C# language defines the precedence of different mathematics operations
    with rules consistent with the rules you learned in mathematics.
    Multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction.
    Explore that by running the following code in the interactive window:

    ```csharp
    int a = 5;
    int b = 4;
    int c = 2;
    int d = a + b * c;
    Console.WriteLine(d);
    ```

    The output demonstrates that the multiplication is performed before the addition.

    You can force a different order of operation by adding parentheses around
    the operation or operations you want performed first:

    ```csharp
    int a = 5;
    int b = 4;
    int c = 2;
    int d = (a  + b) * c;
    Console.WriteLine(d);
    ```

    Explore more by combining many different operations. Try something like this:

    ```csharp
    int d = (a + b) - 6 * c + (12 * 4) / 3 + 12;
    ```

    You may have noticed an interesting behavior for integers. Integer
    division always produces an integer result, even when the mathematic
    result would include a decimal or fraction portion.

    If you haven't seen this behavior, try the following:

    ```csharp
    int a = 7;
    int b = 4;
    int c = 3;
    int d = (a  + b) / c;
    Console.WriteLine(d);
    ```

    Click 'Run' again to see the results.
- title: Integer precision and limits
  durationInMinutes: 4

    That last sample showed you that integer division truncates the result.
    You can get the **remainder** by using the **modulo** operator, the `%` character:

    ```csharp
    int a = 7;
    int b = 4;
    int c = 3;
    int d = (a  + b) / c;
    int e = (a + b) % c;
    Console.WriteLine("quotient: " + d);
    Console.WriteLine("remainder: " + e);
    ```

    The C# integer type differs from mathematical integers in one other
    way: the `int` type has minimum and maximum limits. Run this code
    in the interactive window to see those limits:
    
    ```csharp
    int max = int.MaxValue;
    int min = int.MinValue;
    Console.WriteLine("The range of integers is " + min + " to " + max);
    ```

    If a calculation produces a value that exceeds those limits, you
    have an **underflow** or **overflow** condition. The answer appears
    to wrap from one limit to the other. Add these two lines to the interactive
    window to see an example:

    ```csharp
    int what = max + 3;
    Console.WriteLine("an example of overflow: " + what);
    ```
    
    Notice that the answer is very close to the minimum (negative) integer. It's
    the same as `min + 2`. 
    The addition operation **overflowed** the allowed values for integers.

    There are other numeric types with different limits and precision that you
    would use when the `int` type does not meet your needs. Let's explore those next.

- title: Working with the double type.
  durationInMinutes: 4
  content: |
    The `double` numeric type represents a double-precision floating point
    number. Those terms may be new to you. A **floating point** number is
    useful to represent non-integral numbers that may be very large, or small
    in magnitude. **Double-precision** means that these numbers are stored
    using greater precision than **single-precision**. On modern computers,
    it is more common to use double precision than single precision numbers.
    Let's explore. Try the code below in the interactive window and see the result.

    ```csharp
    double a = 5;
    double b = 4;
    double c = 2;
    double d = (a  + b) / c;
    Console.WriteLine(d);
    ```

    Notice that the answer includes the decimal portion of the quotient. Try a slightly
    more complicted expression with doubles:

    ```csharp
    double a = 19;
    double b = 23;
    double c = 8;
    double d = (a  + b) / c;
    Console.WriteLine(d);
    ```

    The range of a double value is much greater than integer values. Try the following
    code in the interactive window:

    ```csharp
    double max = double.MaxValue;
    double min = double.MinValue;
    Console.WriteLine("The range of double is " + min + " to " + max);
    ```

    These values are printed out to represent scientific notation. The number to
    the left of the `E` is the signifant. The number to the right is the exponent,
    as a power of 10. Internally, these numbers are represented similarly, but in 
    a binary form. One part represents the significant binary digits.
    Another part represents where to place the binary point (analogous to a decimal point) relative to
    those significant digits.

        Just like decimal numbers in math, doubles in C# can have rounding error. Try this code:

    ```csharp
    double third = 1.0 / 3.0;
    Console.WriteLine(third);
    ```
    
    You know that `0.3` repeating is not exactly the same as `1/3`.

        ***Challenge***

    Try other calculations with large numbers, small numbers, multiplication
    and division using the `double` type.  Try more complicated calculations.


- title: Fixed point types
  durationInMinutes: 4
  content: |
    You've seen the basic numeric types in C#: integers and doubles.  There is one
    other type to learn: the `decimal` type. The `decimal` type has a smaller
    range, but greater precision than `double`. The term **fixed point** means
    that the decimal point (or binary point) does not move. Let's take a look:

    ```csharp
    decimal min = decimal.MinValue;
    decimal max = decimal.MaxValue;
    Console.WriteLine("the range of the decimal type is " + min + " to " + max);
    ```

    Notice that the range is smaller than the `double` type. You can see the greater
    precision with the decimal type by trying the following code:

    ```csharp
    double a = 1.0;
    double b = 3.0;
    Console.WriteLine(a / b);

    decimal c = 1.0M;
    decimal d = 3.0M;
    Console.WriteLine(c / d);
    ```

    The `M` suffix on the numbers is how you indicate that a constant should use the
    `decimal` type.

    Notice that the math done using the decimal type has more digits to the right
    of the decimal point. 

    ***Challenge***

    Now that you've seen the different numeric types, write code that calculates
    the area of a circle whose radius is 2.50 inches. Remember that the area of a circle
    is the radius squared multiplied by PI. One hint: C# contains a constant
    for PI: `Math.PI` that you can use for that value. 

- title: Complete challenge

    Did you come up with something like this?

    ```csharp
    double radius = 2.50;
    double area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
    Console.WriteLine(area);
    ```
    You've completed the "working with numbers" tutorial.
