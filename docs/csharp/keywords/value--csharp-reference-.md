# value (C# Reference)
The contextual keyword `value` is used in the set accessor in ordinary property declarations. It is similar to an input parameter on a method. The word `value` references the value that client code is attempting to assign to the property. In the following example, `MyDerivedClass` has a property called `Name` that uses the `value` parameter to assign a new string to the backing field `name`. From the point of view of client code, the operation is written as a simple assignment.
