# Getting started with Visual Studio Code

.NET Core gives you a fast and modular platform for creating server applications that run on Windows, Linux and macOS. Use Visual Studio Code with the C# extension to get a powerful editing experience with full support for C# IntelliSense (smart code completion) and debugging.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install [.NET Core](https://microsoft.com/net/core).
3. Install the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) from the VS Code Marketplace.

## Hello World

If you'd like to get started with a simple "Hello World" program on .NET Core, follow the steps below:

1. Open a project:

    * Open VS Code.
    * Go to the File Explorer Tab on the left.
    * Open the folder you want you C# project to be in.

2. Initialize a C# project:
    * Open the command prompt (or terminal). You can open the terminal from VS Code by typing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> (Back Tick)
    * Type `dotnet new`
    * This creates a `Program.cs` file in your folder with a simple "Hello World" program already written.

3. Resolve the build assets by typing `dotnet restore`

    * Running `restore` pulls down the required packages declared in the `project.json` file.
    * You'll see a new `project.lock.json` file in your project folder.
    * This file contains information about your project's dependencies to make subsequent restores quicker.

4. Run the "Hello World" program by typing `dotnet run`
