# Advanced Query Techniques (LINQ to XML) (C#)
This section provides examples of more advanced [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] query techniques.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[How to: Join Two Collections (LINQ to XML) (C#)](../linq/how-to--join-two-collections--linq-to-xml---csharp-.md)|Shows how to use the `Join` clause to take advantage of relationships in XML data.|  
|[How to: Create Hierarchy Using Grouping (C#)](../linq/how-to--create-hierarchy-using-grouping--csharp-.md)|Shows how to group data, and then generate XML based on the grouping.|  
|[How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (C#)](../linq/how-to--query-linq-to-xml-using-xpath--csharp-.md)|Shows how to retrieve collections based on XPath queries.|  
|[How to: Write a LINQ to XML Axis Method (C#)](../linq/how-to--write-a-linq-to-xml-axis-method--csharp-.md)|Shows how to write a [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] axis method.|
