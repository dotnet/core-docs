# Compiler Error CS0025
Standard library file 'file' could not be found  
  
 A file that is needed by the compiler was not found. Check that the path is correct and that the file exists.  
  
 If the file is a Visual Studio system file, you may need to repair your Visual Studio installation, or reinstall it completely.
