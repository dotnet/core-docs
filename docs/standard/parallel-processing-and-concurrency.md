# Parallel Processing and Concurrency in .NET
.NET provides several ways for you to use multiple threads of execution to keep your application responsive to your user while maximizing the performance of your user's computer.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Asynchronous Programming](../../docs/standard/async.md)  
 Describes mechanisms for asynchronous programming provided by .NET.  
  
 [Parallel Programming](../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/index.md)  
 Describes a task-based programming model that simplifies parallel development, enabling you to write efficient, fine-grained, and scalable parallel code in a natural idiom without having to work directly with threads or the thread pool.  

 [Threading](../../docs/standard/threading/index.md)  
 Describes the basic concurrency and synchronization mechanisms provided by .NET.
