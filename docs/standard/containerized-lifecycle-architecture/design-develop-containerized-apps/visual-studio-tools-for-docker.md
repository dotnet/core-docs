# Use Visual Studio Tools for Docker

The Visual Studio Tools for Docker developer workflow is similar to using Visual Studio Code and Docker CLI (it is based on the same Docker CLI). Visual Studio Tools for Docker makes it even easier to get started, simplifies the process, and provides greater productivity for the build, run, and compose tasks. Execute and debug your containers via simple actions like **F5** and **Ctrl**+**F5**.

## Configure your local environment

With the latest versions of Docker for Windows ([https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)), the straightforward setup makes it easy to develop Docker applications.

Docker support is included in Visual Studio 2017. Download Visual Studio 2017 here: [https://aka.ms/vsdownload?utm_source=mscom&utm_campaign=msdocs](https://aka.ms/vsdownload?utm_source=mscom&utm_campaign=msdocs)

## Use Docker Tools in Visual Studio 2017

There are two levels of Docker support you can add to a project. Adding [Docker support](#add-docker-support) adds a *Dockerfile* file to the project. Adding [container orchestrator support](#add-container-orchestrator-support) adds a *Dockerfile* to the project and a *docker-compose.yml* file at the solution level. The **Add** > **Docker Support** and **Add** > **Container Orchestrator Support** commands are located on the right-click menu (or context menu) of the project node for an ASP.NET Core web app project in **Solution Explorer**:

### Add Docker support

You can add Docker support to an existing web app project by selecting **Add** > **Docker Support** in **Solution Explorer**, or you can enable Docker support during project creation. To enable Docker support during project creation, select **Enable Docker Support** in the **New ASP.NET Core Web Application** dialog box that opens after you click **OK** in the **New Project** dialog box.

When you add or enable Docker support, Visual Studio adds a *Dockerfile* file to the project.

### Add container orchestrator support

Add container orchestrator support to compose a multicontainer solution. When you add container orchestrator support, Visual Studio not only adds a *Dockerfile* to the project, but also a global *docker-compose.yml* file at the solution level. This lets you run and debug a group of containers (a whole solution) at the same time if they're defined in the same *docker-compose.yml* file. If *docker-compose.yml* already exists, Visual Studio adds the required lines of configuration code to it.

After you add container orchestration support to your project, you see the following new project and files in **Solution Explorer**:

> [!NOTE]
> The **Add** > **Container Orchestrator Support** menu item is available in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8 and later. In prior versions of Visual Studio, adding Docker support to a project also added a *docker-compose.yml* file at the solution level.
