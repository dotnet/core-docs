# Manipulating Strings

.NET Core provides an extensive set of routines that enable you to efficiently create, compare, and modify strings as well as rapidly parse large amounts of text and data to search for, remove, and replace text patterns.

## In This Section

[Best Practices for Using Strings](bestpractices.md)  - Examines string-sorting, comparison, and casing methods in .NET Core, and provides recommendations for selecting a string-handling method . 

[Regular Expressions](regularexpressions.md) - Provides detailed information about .NET Core regular expressions, including language elements, regular expression behavior, and examples.

[Basic String Operations](basicstringoperations.md) - Describes string operations provided by the [System.String](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/api/System.String) and [System.Text.StringBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/api/System.Text.StringBuilder) classes, including creating new strings from arrays of bytes, comparing string values, and modifying existing strings.

[Character Encoding in .NET Core](characterencoding.md) - Describes how to encode and decode character formats such as Unicode.
