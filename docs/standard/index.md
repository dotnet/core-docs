# .NET guide

The .NET guide provides information about .NET. Depending on your familiarity with .NET, you may wish to explore different sections of this guide and other guides such as [.NET Core](../core/index.yml) or [.NET Framework](../framework/index.yml).

## New to .NET

If you want a high-level overview of .NET, see [What is .NET?](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet).

If you're new to .NET, see [Get started](get-started.md).

If you prefer to have a guided tour through major features of .NET, see [Tour of .NET](tour.md).

For an overview of the various pieces of .NET and how they fit together, see [.NET architectural components](components.md).

## New to .NET Core

If you're new to .NET Core, check out [Get started with .NET Core](../core/get-started.md).

## New to .NET Standard

If you're new to .NET Standard, check out [.NET Standard](net-standard.md).

## Port .NET Framework code to .NET Standard or .NET Core

To port an application, service, component, or NuGet package to .NET Standard or .NET Core, see [Port to .NET Core from .NET Framework](../core/porting/index.md). Tooling for .NET Standard and .NET Core is shared, so the content is relevant for porting to both frameworks.

## .NET concepts

For more information about the major concepts of .NET, see:

* [.NET architectural components](components.md)
* [.NET Standard](net-standard.md)

* [Garbage collection](garbage-collection/index.md)
* [Collections](collections/index.md)
* [Dates, times, and time zones](datetime/index.md)
