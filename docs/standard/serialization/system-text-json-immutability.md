## Immutable types and Records

::: zone pivot="dotnet-5-0"
`System.Text.Json` can use a parameterized constructor, which makes it possible to deserialize an immutable class or struct. For a class, if the only constructor is a parameterized one, that constructor will be used. For a struct, or a class with multiple constructors, specify the one to use by applying the [[JsonConstructor]](xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonConstructorAttribute.%23ctor%2A) attribute. When the attribute is not used, a public parameterless constructor is always used if present. The attribute can only be used with public constructors. The following example uses the `[JsonConstructor]` attribute:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/system-text-json-how-to-5-0/csharp/ImmutableTypes.cs" highlight="13":::

Records in C# 9 are also supported, as shown in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/system-text-json-how-to-5-0/csharp/Records.cs":::

For types that are immutable because all their property setters are non-public, see the following section about [non-public property accessors](#non-public-property-accessors).

::: zone pivot="dotnet-core-3-1"
`JsonConstructorAttribute` and C# 9 Record support aren't available in .NET Core 3.1.

## Non-public property accessors

::: zone pivot="dotnet-5-0"
To enable use of a non-public property accessor, use the [[JsonInclude]](xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonIncludeAttribute) attribute, as shown in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/system-text-json-how-to-5-0/csharp/NonPublicAccessors.cs" highlight="12,15":::
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="dotnet-core-3-1"
Non-public property accessors are not supported in .NET Core 3.1. For more information, see [the Migrate from Newtonsoft.Json article](system-text-json-migrate-from-newtonsoft-how-to.md#non-public-property-setters-and-getters).
