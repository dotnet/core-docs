# Manipulating Strings in the .NET Framework
The .NET Framework provides an extensive set of routines that enable you to efficiently create, compare, and modify strings as well as rapidly parse large amounts of text and data to search for, remove, and replace text patterns.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Best Practices for Using Strings](../../../docs/standard/base-types/best-practices-strings.md)  
 Examines string-sorting, comparison, and casing methods in the .NET Framework, and provides recommendations for selecting a string-handling method .  
  
 [.NET Framework Regular Expressions](../../../docs/standard/base-types/regular-expressions.md)  
 Provides detailed information about .NET Framework regular expressions, including language elements, regular expression behavior, and examples.  
  
 [Basic String Operations](../../../docs/standard/base-types/basic-string-operations.md)  
 Describes string operations provided by the <xref:System.String?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder?displayProperty=fullName> classes, including creating new strings from arrays of bytes, comparing string values, and modifying existing strings.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Type Conversion in the .NET Framework](../../../docs/standard/base-types/type-conversion.md)  
 Explains the techniques and rules used to convert types using the .NET Framework.  
  
 [Formatting Types](../../../docs/standard/base-types/formatting-types.md)  
 Provides how to use the base class library to implement formatting, how to format numeric types, how to format string types, and how to format for a specific culture.  
  
 [Parsing Strings](../../../docs/standard/base-types/parsing-strings.md)  
 Describes how to initialize objects to the values described by string representations of those objects. Parsing is the inverse operation of formatting.
