# Key takeaways

-   Container-based solutions ultimately provide cost savings benefits. Containers are a solution to deployment problems because they remove the friction caused by lack of dependencies in production environments. Removing those issues, it improves Dev/Test, DevOps and production operations significantly.

-   Docker is becoming the de facto standard in the container industry. Docker is supported by the most prominent vendors in the Linux and Windows ecosystems, including Microsoft. In the future, provides the most comprehensive and complete environment to modernize your existing .NET Framework applications with Windows Containers and Azure infrastructure services A Docker container is becoming the standard unit of deployment for any server-based application or service.

-   For production environments, you should use an orchestrator (like Service Fabric or Kubernetes) to host scalable Windows Containers­­–based applications.

-   Azure VMs hosting containers are a fast and simple way to create small Dev/Test environments in the cloud.

-   Azure SQL Database Managed Instance is the recommended "by default" choice when migrating your relational databases, from existing applications, to Azure

-   Visual Studio 2017 and Image2Docker are fundamental tools for you to start modernizing your existing .NET applications with Windows Containers by accelerating the getting started learning curve.

-   When establishing containerized applications in production you will always need to settle it down on a DevOps culture and DevOps tools for CI/CD pipelines, like Visual Studio Team Services or Jenkins.

-   Microsoft Azure provides the most comprehensive and complete environment to modernize your existing .NET Framework applications with Windows Containers, cloud infrastructure and PaaS services.
