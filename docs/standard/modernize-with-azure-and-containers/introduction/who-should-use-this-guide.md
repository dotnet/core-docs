# Who should use this guide

We wrote this guide for developers and solution architects who want to modernize existing ASP.NET applications that are based on the .NET Framework, for improved agility in shipping and releasing applications.

You also might find this guide useful if you are a technical decision maker, such as an enterprise architect or a development lead/director who just wants an overview of the benefits that you can get by using Windows Containers, and by deploying to the cloud when using Microsoft Azure.
