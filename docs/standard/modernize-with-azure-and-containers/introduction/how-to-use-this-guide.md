# How to use this guide

This guide addresses the "why"-why you might want to modernize your existing applications, and the specific benefits you get from using Windows Containers when you move your apps to the cloud. The content in the first few chapters of the guide is designed for architects and technical decision makers who want an overview, but who don't need to focus on implementation and technical, step-by-step details.

The last chapter of this guide introduces multiple walkthroughs that focus on specific deployment scenarios. In this guide, we offer shorter versions of the walkthroughs, to summarize the scenarios and highlight their benefits. The full walkthroughs drill down into setup and implementation details, and are published as a set of [wiki posts](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing/wiki) in the same public [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopModernizing) where related sample apps reside (discussed in the next section). The last chapter and the step-by-step wiki walkthroughs on GitHub will be of more interest to developers and architects who want to focus on implementation details.
