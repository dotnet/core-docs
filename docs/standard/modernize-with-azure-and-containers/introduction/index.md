When you decide to modernize your web applications and move them to the cloud, you don't necessarily have to fully re-architect your apps. Re-architecting an application by using an advanced approach like microservices isn't always an option, because of cost and time restraints. Depending on the type of application, re-architecting an app also might not be necessary. To optimize the cost-effectiveness of your organization's cloud migration strategy, it's important to consider the needs of your business and requirements of your apps. You'll need to determine:

-   Which apps require a transformation or re-architecting.

-   Which apps need to be only partially modernized.

-   Which apps you can "lift and shift" directly to the cloud.
