# About this guide

This guide focuses primarily on "lift and shift" scenarios, and initial modernization of existing Microsoft .NET Framework web or service-oriented applications. Lift and shift is the action of moving a workload to a newer or more modern environment without altering the application's code and basic architecture.

This guide describes how to move your existing .NET Framework server-applications directly to the cloud by modernizing specific areas, without re-architecting or recoding entire applications.

This guide also highlights the benefits of moving your apps to the cloud and partially modernizing apps by using a specific set of new technologies and approaches, like Windows Containers and orchestrators in Azure.
