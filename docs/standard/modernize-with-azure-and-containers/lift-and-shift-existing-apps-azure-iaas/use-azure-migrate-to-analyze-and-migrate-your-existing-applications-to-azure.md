# Use Azure Migrate to analyze and migrate your existing applications to Azure

Migrating to the cloud doesn't have to be difficult. But many organizations struggle to get started - to get deep visibility into the environment and the tight interdependencies between applications, workloads, and data. Without that visibility, it can be difficult to plan the path forward. Without detailed information on what's required for a successful migration, you can't have the right conversations within your organization. You don't know enough about the potential cost benefits, or whether workloads could just lift-and-shift or would require significant rework to migrate successfully. No wonder many organizations hesitate.

[Azure Migrate](https://aka.ms/azuremigrate) is a new service that provides the guidance, insights, and mechanisms needed to assist you in migrating to Azure. Azure Migrate provides:

-   Discovery and assessment for on-premises virtual machines

-   Inbuilt dependency mapping for high-confidence discovery of multi-tier applications

-   Intelligent rightsizing to Azure virtual machines

-   Compatibility reporting with guidelines for remediating potential issues

-   Integration with Azure Database Management Service for database discovery and migration

Azure Migrate gives you confidence that your workloads can migrate with minimal impact to the business and run as expected in Azure. With the right tools and guidance, you can achieve maximum return on investment while assuring that critical performance and reliability needs are met.

Figure 2-2 shows you the built-in dependency mapping for all server and application connections performed by Azure Migrate.
