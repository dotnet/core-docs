# Why migrate existing .NET web applications to Azure IaaS 

The main reason to migrate to the cloud, even at an initial IaaS level, is to achieve cost reductions. By using more managed infrastructure services, your organization can lower its investment in hardware maintenance, server or VM provisioning and deployment, and infrastructure management.

After you make the decision to move your apps to the cloud, the main reason why you might choose IaaS instead of more advanced options like PaaS is simply that the IaaS environment will be more familiar. Moving to an environment that's similar to your current, on-premises environment offers a lower learning curve, which makes it the quickest path to the cloud.

However, taking the quickest path to the cloud doesn't mean that you will gain the most benefit from having your applications running in the cloud. Any organization will gain the most significant benefits from a cloud migration at the already introduced Cloud DevOps-Ready and PaaS (Cloud-Optimized) maturity levels.

It also has become evident that applications are easier to modernize and re-architect in the future when they are already running in the cloud, even on IaaS. This is true in part because application data migration has already been achieved. Also, your organization will have gained skills required for working in the cloud, and made the shift to operating in a "cloud culture."
