> Vision: As a first step, to reduce your on-premises investment and total cost of hardware and networking maintenance, simply rehost your existing applications in the cloud.

Before getting into *how* to migrate your existing applications to the Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform, it's important to analyze the reasons *why* you'd want to migrate directly to IaaS in Azure. The scenario at this modernization maturity level essentially is to start using VMs in the cloud, instead of continuing to use your current, on-premises infrastructure.

Another point to analyze is *why* you might want to migrate to pure IaaS cloud instead of just adding more advanced managed services in Azure. You need to determine what cases might require IaaS in the first place.
