# Unit Testing ASP&period;NET Core Apps

In a well-designed ASP&period;NET Core application, most of the complexity and business logic will be encapsulated in business entities and a variety of services. The ASP&period;NET Core MVC app itself, with its controllers, filters, viewmodels, and views, should require very few unit tests. Much of the functionality of a given action lies outside the action method itself. Testing whether routing works correctly, or global error handling, cannot be done effectively with a unit test. Likewise, any filters, including model validation and authentication and authorization filters, cannot be unit tested. Without these sources of behavior, most action methods should be trivially small, delegating the bulk of their work to services that can be tested independent of the controller that uses them.

Sometimes you'll need to refactor your code in order to unit test it. Frequently this involves identifying abstractions and using dependency injection to access the abstraction in the code you'd like to test, rather than coding directly against infrastructure. For example, consider this simple action method for displaying images:

```cs
[HttpGet("[controller]/pic/{id}")]
public IActionResult GetImage(int id)
{
    var contentRoot = _env.ContentRootPath + "//Pics";
    var path = Path.Combine(contentRoot, id + ".png");
    Byte[] b = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(path);
    return File(b, "image/png");
}
```

Unit testing this method is made difficult by its direct dependency on System.IO.File, which it uses to read from the file system. You can test this behavior to ensure it works as expected, but doing so with real files is an integration test. It's worth noting you can't test this method's route â€“ you'll see how to do this with a functional test shortly.

If you can't unit test the file system behavior directly, and you can't test the route, what is there to test? Well, after refactoring to make unit testing possible, you may discover some test cases and missing behavior, such as error handling. What does the method do when a file isn't found? What should it do? In this example, the refactored method looks like this:

```cs
[HttpGet("[controller]/pic/{id}")\]
public IActionResult GetImage(int id)
{
    byte[] imageBytes;
    try
    {
        imageBytes = _imageService.GetImageBytesById(id);
    }
    catch (CatalogImageMissingException ex)
    {
        _logger.LogWarning($"No image found for id: {id}");
        return NotFound();
    }
    return File(imageBytes, "image/png");
}
```

The \_logger and \_imageService are both injected as dependencies. Now you can test that the same id that is passed to the action method is passed to the \_imageService, and that the resulting bytes are returned as part of the FileResult. You can also test that error logging is happening as expected, and that a NotFound result is returned if the image is missing, assuming this is important application behavior (that is, not just temporary code the developer added to diagnose an issue). The actual file logic has moved into a separate implementation service, and has been augmented to return an application-specific exception for the case of a missing file. You can test this implementation independently, using an integration test.
