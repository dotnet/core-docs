# Architecture Recommendations

Your application's requirements should dictate its architecture. There are many different Azure services available, choosing the right one is an important decision. Microsoft offers a gallery of reference architectures to help identify typical architectures optimized for common scenarios. You may bind a reference architecture that maps closely to your application's requirements, or at least offers a starting point.

Figure 11-X shows an example reference architecture. This diagram describes a recommended architecture approach for a Sitecore content management system website optimized for marketing.
