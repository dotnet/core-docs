# Summary

Modern web applications have higher user expectations and greater demands than ever before. Today's web apps are expected to be available 24/7 from anywhere in the world, and usable from virtually any device or screen size. Web applications must be secure, flexible, and scalable to meet spikes in demand. Increasingly, complex scenarios should be handled by rich user experiences built on the client using JavaScript, and communicating efficiently through web APIs.

ASP&period;NET Core is optimized for modern web applications and cloud-based hosting scenarios. Its modular design enables applications to depend on only those features they actually use, improving application security and performance while reducing hosting resource requirements.
