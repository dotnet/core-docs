# Traditional ASP&period;NET and Web Forms

In addition to ASP&period;NET Core, traditional ASP&period;NET 4.x continues to be a robust and reliable platform for building web applications. ASP&period;NET supports MVC and Web API development models, as well as Web Forms, which is well-suited to rich page-based application development and features a rich third-party component ecosystem. Windows Azure has great longstanding support for ASP&period;NET 4.x applications, and many developers are familiar with this platform.
