# Simple Development and Deployment

ASP&period;NET Core applications can be written using simple text editors and command line interfaces, or full-featured development environments like Visual Studio. Monolithic applications are typically deployed to a single endpoint. Deployments can easily be automated to occur as part of a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipeline. In addition to traditional CI/CD tools, Windows Azure has integrated support for git repositories and can automatically deploy updates as they are made to a specified git branch or tag.
