# Cloud-Hosted and Scalable

ASP&period;NET Core is optimized for the cloud (public cloud, private cloud, any cloud) because it is low-memory and high-throughput. The smaller footprint of ASP&period;NET Core applications means you can host more of them on the same hardware, and you pay for fewer resources when using pay-as-you go cloud hosting services. The higher-throughput means you can serve more customers from an application given the same hardware, further reducing the need to invest in servers and hosting infrastructure.
