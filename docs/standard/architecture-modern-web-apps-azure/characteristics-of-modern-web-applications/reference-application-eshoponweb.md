# Reference Application: eShopOnWeb

This guidance includes a reference application, *eShopOnWeb*, that demonstrates some of the principles and recommendations. The application is a simple online store which supports browsing through a catalog of shirts, coffee mugs, and other marketing items. The reference application is deliberately simple in order to make it easy to understand.
