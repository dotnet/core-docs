# Cross Platform

ASP&period;NET Core is cross-platform, and can run on Linux and MacOS as well as Windows. This opens up many new options for both development and deployment of apps built with ASP&period;NET Core. Docker containers, which typically run Linux today, can host ASP&period;NET Core applications, allowing them to take advantage of the benefits of containers and microservices (link to microservices and containers ebook).
