# Azure DocumentDB

Azure DocumentDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that offers cloud-based schema-free data storage. DocumentDB is built for fast and predictable performance, high availability, elastic scaling, and global distribution. Despite being a NoSQL database, developers can use rich and familiar SQL query capabilities on JSON data. All resources in DocumentDB are stored as JSON documents. Resources are managed as *items*, which are documents containing metadata, and *feeds*, which are collections of items. Figure 8-X shows the relationship between different DocumentDB resources.

The DocumentDB query language is a simple yet powerful interface for querying JSON documents. The language supports a subset of ANSI SQL grammar and adds deep integration of JavaScript object, arrays, object construction, and function invocation.
