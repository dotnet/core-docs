# Other Persistence Options

In addition to relational and NoSQL storage options, ASP&period;NET Core applications can use Azure Storage to store a variety of data formats and files in a cloud-based, scalable fashion. Azure Storage is massively scalable, so you can start out storing small amounts of data and scale up to storing hundreds or terabytes if your application requires it. Azure Storage supports four kinds of data:

-   Blob Storage for unstructured text or binary storage, also referred to as object storage.

-   Table Storage for structured datasets, accessible via row keys.

-   Queue Storage for reliable queue-based messaging.

-   File Storage for shared file access between Azure virtual machines and on-premises applications.
