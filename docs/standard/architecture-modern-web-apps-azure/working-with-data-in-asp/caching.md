# Caching

In web applications, each web request should be completed in the shortest time possible. One way to achieve this is to limit the number of external calls the server must make to complete the request. Caching involves storing a copy of data on the server (or another data store that is more easily queried than the source of the data). Web applications, and especially non-SPA traditional web applications, need to build the entire user interface with every request. This frequently involves making many of the same database queries repeatedly from one user request to the next. In most cases, this data changes rarely, so there is little reason to constantly request it from the database. ASP&period;NET Core supports response caching, for caching entire pages, and data caching, which supports more granular caching behavior.

When implementing caching, it's important to keep in mind separation of concerns. Avoid implementing caching logic in your data access logic, or in your user interface. Instead, encapsulate caching in its own classes, and use configuration to manage its behavior. This follows the Open/Closed and Single Responsibility principles, and will make it easier for you to manage how you use caching in your application as it grows.

## ASP&period;NET Core Response Caching

ASP&period;NET Core supports two levels of response caching. The first level does not cache anything on the server, but adds HTTP headers that instruct clients and proxy servers to cache responses. This is implemented by adding the ResponseCache attribute to individual controllers or actions:

```cs
    [ResponseCache(Duration = 60)]
    public IActionResult Contact()
    { }
    
    ViewData["Message"] = "Your contact page.";
    return View();
}

The above example will result in the following header being added to the response, instructing clients to cache the result for up to 60 seconds.

Cache-Control: public,max-age=60

In order to add server-side in-memory caching to the application, you must reference the Microsoft.AspNetCore.ResponseCaching NuGet package, and then add the Response Caching middleware. This middleware is configured in both ConfigureServices and Configure in Startup:

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddResponseCaching();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseResponseCaching();
}
```

The Response Caching Middleware will automatically cache responses based on a set of conditions, which you can customize. By default, only 200 (OK) responses requested via GET or HEAD methods are cached. In addition, requests must have a response with a Cache-Control: public header, and cannot include headers for Authorization or Set-Cookie. See a [complete list of the caching conditions used by the response caching middleware](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/middleware#conditions-for-caching).

## Data Caching

Rather than (or in addition to) caching full web responses, you can cache the results of individual data queries. For this, you can use in memory caching on the web server, or use [a distributed cache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/distributed). This section will demonstrate how to implement in memory caching.

You add support for memory (or distributed) caching in ConfigureServices:

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMemoryCache();
    services.AddMvc();
}
```

Be sure to add the Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory NuGet package as well.

Once you've added the service, you request IMemoryCache via dependency injection wherever you need to access the cache. In this example, the CachedCatalogService is using the Proxy (or Decorator) design pattern, by providing an alternative implementation of ICatalogService that controls access to (or adds behavior to) the underlying CatalogService implementation.

```cs
public class CachedCatalogService : ICatalogService
{
    private readonly IMemoryCache _cache;
    private readonly CatalogService _catalogService;
    private static readonly string _brandsKey = "brands";
    private static readonly string _typesKey = "types";
    private static readonly string _itemsKeyTemplate = "items-{0}-{1}-{2}-{3}";
    private static readonly TimeSpan _defaultCacheDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);
    public CachedCatalogService(IMemoryCache cache,
    CatalogService catalogService)
    {
        _cache = cache;
        _catalogService = catalogService;
    }
    
    public async Task<IEnumerable<SelectListItem>> GetBrands()
    {
        return await _cache.GetOrCreateAsync(_brandsKey, async entry =>
        {
            entry.SlidingExpiration = _defaultCacheDuration;
            return await _catalogService.GetBrands();
        });
    }
    
    public async Task<Catalog> GetCatalogItems(int pageIndex, int itemsPage, int? brandID, int? typeId)
    {
        string cacheKey = String.Format(_itemsKeyTemplate, pageIndex, itemsPage, brandID, typeId);
        return await _cache.GetOrCreateAsync(cacheKey, async entry =>
        {
            entry.SlidingExpiration = _defaultCacheDuration;
            return await _catalogService.GetCatalogItems(pageIndex, itemsPage, brandID, typeId);
        });
    }
    
    public async Task<IEnumerable<SelectListItem>> GetTypes()
    {
        return await _cache.GetOrCreateAsync(_typesKey, async entry =>
        {
            entry.SlidingExpiration = _defaultCacheDuration;
            return await _catalogService.GetTypes();
        });
    }
}
```

To configure the application to use the cached version of the service, but still allow the service to get the instance of CatalogService it needs in its constructor, you would add the following in ConfigureServices:

```cs
services.AddMemoryCache();
services.AddScoped<ICatalogService, CachedCatalogService>();
services.AddScoped<CatalogService>();
```

With this in place, the database calls to fetch the catalog data will only be made once per minute, rather than on every request. Depending on the traffic to the site, this can have a very significant impact on the number of queries made to the database, and the average page load time for the home page that currently depends on all three of the queries exposed by this service.

An issue that arises when caching is implemented is *stale data* â€“ that is, data that has changed at the source but an out of date version remains in the cache. A simple way to mitigate this issue is to use small cache durations, since for a busy application there is limited additional benefit to extending the length data is cached. For example, consider a page that makes a single database query, and is requested 10 times per second. If this page is cached for one minute, it will result in the number of database queries made per minute to drop from 600 to 1, a reduction of 99.8%. If instead the cache duration were made one hour, the overall reduction would be 99.997%, but now the likelihood and potential age of stale data are both increased dramatically.

Another approach is to proactively remove cache entries when the data they contain is updated. Any individual entry can be removed if its key is known:

```cs
_cache.Remove(cacheKey);
```

If your application exposes functionality for updating entries that it caches, you can remove the corresponding cache entries in your code that performs the updates. Sometimes there may be many different entries that depend on a particular set of data. In that case, it can be useful to create dependencies between cache entries, by using a CancellationChangeToken. With a CancellationChangeToken, you can expire multiple cache entries at once by cancelling the token.

```cs
// configure CancellationToken and add entry to cache
var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
_cache.Set("cts", cts);
_cache.Set(cacheKey,
itemToCache,
new CancellationChangeToken(cts.Token));

// elsewhere, expire the cache by cancelling the token\
_cache.Get&lt;CancellationTokenSource&gt;("cts").Cancel();
```
