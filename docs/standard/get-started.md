# Get started

There are a number of ways to get started with .NET. Because .NET is a massive platform, there are multiple articles in this documentation that can help you get started with .NET, each from a different perspective.

## Get started using .NET languages

* The [C# getting started](../csharp/getting-started/index.md) articles and [C# tutorials](../csharp/tutorials/index.md) provide ways to get started in a C#-centric way.

* The [F# getting started](../fsharp/get-started/index.md) tutorials cover the three primary ways you can use F#: with Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or command-line tools.

* The [Visual Basic getting started](../visual-basic/getting-started/index.md) articles provide guides for using Visual Basic in Visual Studio.

## Get started using .NET Core

* [Get started with .NET Core](../core/get-started.md) provides an overview of articles that show how to get started with .NET Core on different operating systems and using different tools.

* The [.NET Core tutorials](../core/tutorials/index.md) detail ways you can get started with .NET Core using your operating system and tooling of choice.

## Get started using .NET Standard

* For an introductory tutorial, see [Build a .NET Standard library in Visual Studio](../core/tutorials/library-with-visual-studio.md).

## Get started using .NET Core on Docker

[Introduction to .NET and Docker](../core/docker/introduction.md) shows how you can use .NET Core on Windows Docker containers.
