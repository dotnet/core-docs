# Related microservice and container-based reference application: eShopOnContainers

The eShopOnContainers application is a reference app for .NET Core and microservices that is designed to be deployed using Docker containers. The application consists of multiple subsystems, including several e-store UI front ends (a Web app and a native mobile app). It also includes the back-end microservices and containers for all required server-side operations.

This microservice and container-based application source code is open source and available at the [eShopOnContainers](http://aka.ms/MicroservicesArchitecture) GitHub repo.
