# What this guide does not cover

This guide does not focus on the application lifecycle, DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, or team work. The complementary guide [Containerized Docker Application Lifecycle with Microsoft Platform and Tools](https://aka.ms/dockerlifecycleebook) focuses on that subject. The current guide also does not provide implementation details on Azure infrastructure, such as information on specific orchestrators.

### Additional resources
