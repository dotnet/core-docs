# Welcome to .NET

See [Getting Started with .NET Core](core/getting-started.md) to learn how to create .NET Core apps.

Build many types of apps with .NET, such as cloud, IoT, and games using free cross-platform tools. Your apps can run on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy apps to servers or desktops and publish to app stores for deployment on mobile devices. .NET is accessible to students and hobbyists, and all are welcome to participate in a lively international developer community and make direct contributions to many of the .NET technologies.

## Open source

Key projects from Microsoft have been contributed to the [.NET Foundation](http://dotnetfoundation.org). Many parts of .NET are built with the help of open source contributions from a community of developers around the world. In the [.NET Foundation repositories](https://github.com/dotnet), find the source code and on-going work for [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core), [.NET Core foundational libraries (CoreFX)](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), and the [.NET Core runtime (CoreCLR)](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr). You're welcome to contribute to the [.NET documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/docs). The [ASP.NET repositories](https://github.com/aspnet) are the home for ASP.NET Core source code repositories and documentation. 

## Community

You can join other people who are already active in the [.NET community](https://www.microsoft.com/net/community) to find out what's new or ask for help.
