|    |  Factor | Explanation  |
| :-------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| 1 | Code Base | A single code base for each microservice, stored in its own repository. Tracked with version control, it can deploy to multiple environments (QA, Staging, Production). |
| 2 | Dependencies | Each microservice isolates and packages its own dependencies, embracing changes without impacting the entire system. |
| 3 | Configurations  | Configuration information is moved out of the microservice and externalized through a configuration management tool outside of the code. The same deployment can propagate across environments with the correct configuration applied.  |
| 4 | Backing Services | Ancillary resources (data stores, caches, message brokers) should be exposed via an addressable URL. Doing so decouples the resource from the application, enabling it to be interchangeable.  |
| 5 | Build, Release, Run | Each release must enforce a strict separation across the build, release, and run stages. Each should be tagged with a unique ID and support the ability to roll back. Modern CI/CD systems help fulfill this principle. |
| 6 | Processes | Each microservice should execute in its own process,  isolated from other running services. Externalize required state to a backing service such as a distributed cache or data store. |
| 7 | Port Binding | Each microservice should be self-contained with its interfaces and functionality exposed on its own port. Doing so provides isolation from other microservices. |
| 8 | Concurrency | Services scale out across a large number of small identical processes (copies) as opposed to scaling-up a single large instance on the most powerful machine available. |
| 9 | Disposability | Service instances should be disposable, favoring fast startups to increase scalability opportunities and graceful shutdowns to leave the system in a correct state. Docker containers along with an orchestrator inherently satisfy this requirement. |
| 10 | Dev/Prod Parity | Keep environments across the application lifecycle as similar as possible, avoiding costly shortcuts. Here, the adoption of containers can greatly contribute by promoting the same execution environment. |
| 11 | Logging | Treat logs generated by microservices as event streams. Process them with an event aggregator and propagate the data to data-mining/log management tools like Azure Monitor or Splunk and eventually long-term archival. |
| 12 | Admin Processes | Run administrative/management tasks as one-off processes. Tasks can include data cleanup and pulling analytics for a report. Tools executing these tasks should be  invoked from the production environment, but separately from the application. |

# Summary

In this chapter, we introduced DAPR. Blah. We provided a definition along with the key capabilities that drive a cloud-native application. We looked at the types of applications that might justify this investment and effort.

With the introduction behind, we now dive into a much more detailed look at cloud native.
