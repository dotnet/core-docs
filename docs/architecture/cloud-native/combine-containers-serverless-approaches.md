# Combining containers and serverless approaches

[!INCLUDE [book-preview](../../../includes/book-preview.md)]

Cloud-native applications typically implement services leveraging containers and orchestration. There are often opportunities to expose some of the application's services as Azure Functions. However, with a cloud-native app deployed to Kubernetes, it would be nice to leverage Azure Functions within this same toolset. Fortunately, you can wrap Azure Functions inside Docker containers and deploy them using the same processes and tools as the rest of your Kubernetes-based app.

## When does it make sense to use containers with serverless?

Your Azure Function has no knowledge of the platform on which it's deployed. For some scenarios, you may have specific requirements and need to customize the environment on which your function code will run. You'll need a custom image that supports dependencies or a configuration not supported by the default image. In these cases, it makes sense to deploy your function in a custom Docker container.

## When should you avoid using containers with Azure Functions?

If you want to use consumption billing, you won't be able to run your function in a container. What's more, if you deploy your function to a Kubernetes cluster, you'll no longer benefit from the built-in scaling provided by Azure Functions. You'll need to use Kubernetes' scaling features, described earlier in this chapter.

## How to combine serverless and Docker containers

To wrap an Azure Function in a Docker container, install the [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools) and then run the following command:

```console
func init ProjectName --worker-runtime dotnet --docker
```

When the project is created, it will include a Dockerfile and the worker runtime configured to `dotnet`. Now, you can create and test your function locally. Build and run it using the  `docker build` and `docker run` commands. For detailed steps to get started building Azure Functions with Docker support, see the [Create a function on Linux using a custom image](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-function-linux-custom-image) tutorial.



## How to combine serverless and Kubernetes with KEDA

Azure functions scale automatically to meet demand based on the rate of events that are targeting it. You can always leverage AKS to host your functions and use Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling, or KEDA. When no events are occurring, KEDA can scale down to zero instances.
