# Identity Server

Identity Server is an open source authentication server that implements OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 standards for ASP.NET Core. It's designed to provide a common way to authenticate requests to all of your applications, whether they're web, native, mobile, or API endpoints. Identity Server can be used to implement Single Sign-On (SSO) for multiple applications and application types. It can be used to authenticate actual users via login forms and similar user interfaces as well as service-based authentication that typically involves token issuance, verification, and renewal without any user interface. Identity Server is designed to be a customizable solution. Each instance is typically customized to suit an individual organization and/or set of applications' needs.
