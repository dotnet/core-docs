# ML.NET Documentation

ML.NET is a free, open-source and cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET developers.
 
ML.NET aims to make machine learning **approachable** and **accessible** to .NET developers, without requiring a data science background (though data scientists are welcomed and encouraged to use ML.NET too!).
