# Tutorial: Use ML.NET in a sentiment analysis binary classification scenario

This sample tutorial illustrates using ML.NET to create a sentiment classifier to predict either positive or negative sentiment via a .NET Core console application using C# in Visual Studio 2017. In the world of machine learning, this type of prediction is known as binary classification.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic refers to ML.NET, which is currently in Preview, and material may be subject to change. For more information, visit [the ML.NET introduction](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet).

This tutorial and related sample are currently using **ML.NET version 0.11**. For more information, see the release notes at the [dotnet/machinelearning GitHub repo](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/tree/master/docs/release-notes)

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Sentiment analysis sample overview

The sample is a console app that uses ML.NET to train a model that classifies and predicts sentiment as either positive or negative. The Yelp sentiment dataset is from University of California, Irvine (UCI), which is split into a train dataset and a test dataset. The sample evaluates the model with the test dataset for quality analysis. 

You can find the source code for this tutorial at the [dotnet/samples](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis) repository.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2017 15.6 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=button+cta&utm_content=download+vs2017) with the ".NET Core cross-platform development" workload installed.

* [The UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences dataset zip file](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00331/sentiment%20labelled%20sentences.zip)

## Machine learning workflow

This tutorial follows a machine learning workflow that enables the process to move in an orderly fashion.

The workflow phases are as follows:

1. **Understand the problem**
2. **Prepare your data**
   * **Load the data**
   * **Extract features (Transform your data)**
3. **Build and train** 
   * **Train the model**
   * **Evaluate the model**
4. **Deploy Model**
   * **Use the Model to predict**

### Understand the problem

You first need to understand the problem, so you can break it down to parts that can support building and training the model. Breaking the problem down allows you to predict and evaluate the results.

The problem for this tutorial is to understand incoming website comment sentiment to take the appropriate action.

You can break down the problem to the sentiment text and sentiment value for the data you want to train the model with, and a predicted sentiment value that you can evaluate and then use operationally.

You then need to **determine** the sentiment, which helps you with the machine learning task selection.

## Select the appropriate machine learning algorithm

With this problem, you know the following facts:

Training data: website comments can be positive (1) or negative (0) (**sentiment**).

Predict the **sentiment** of a new website comment, either positive or negative, such as in the following examples:

* I love the wait staff here. They rock.
* This place has the worst soup.

The classification machine learning algorithm is best suited for this scenario.

### About the classification algorithm

Classification is a machine learning algorithm that uses data to **determine** the category, type, or class of an item or row of data. For example, you can use classification to:

* Identify sentiment as positive or negative.
* Classify email as spam, junk, or good.
* Determine whether a patient's lab sample is cancerous.
* Categorize customers by their propensity to respond to a sales campaign.

Classification algorithms are frequently one of the following types:

* Binary: either A or B.
* Multiclass: multiple categories that can be predicted by using a single model.

Because the website comments need to be classified as either positive or negative, you use the Binary Classification algorithm. 

## Create a console application

1. Open Visual Studio 2017. Select **File** > **New** > **Project** from the menu bar. In the **New Project** dialog, select the **Visual C#** node followed by the **.NET Core** node. Then select the **Console App (.NET Core)** project template. In the **Name** text box, type "SentimentAnalysis" and then select the **OK** button.

2. Create a directory named *Data* in your project to save your data set files:

    In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on your project and select **Add** > **New Folder**. Type "Data" and hit Enter.

3. Install the **Microsoft.ML NuGet Package**:

    In Solution Explorer, right-click on your project and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. Choose "nuget.org" as the Package source, select the Browse tab, search for **Microsoft.ML**, select that package in the list, and select the **Install** button. Select the **OK** button on the **Preview Changes** dialog and then select the **I Accept** button on the **License Acceptance** dialog if you agree with the license terms for the packages listed.

### Prepare your data

1. Download [The UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences dataset zip file (see citations in the following note)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00331/sentiment%20labelled%20sentences.zip), and unzip.

2. Copy the `yelp_labelled.txt` file into the *Data* directory you created.

> [!NOTE]
> The datasets this tutorial uses are from the 'From Group to Individual Labels using Deep Features', Kotzias et. al,. KDD 2015, and hosted at the UCI Machine Learning Repository - Dua, D. and Karra Taniskidou, E. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.

3. In Solution Explorer, right-click the `yelp_labeled.txt` file and select **Properties**. Under **Advanced**, change the value of **Copy to Output Directory** to **Copy if newer**.

### Create classes and define paths

Add the following additional `using` statements to the top of the *Program.cs* file:

[!code-csharp[AddUsings](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#AddUsings "Add necessary usings")]

You need to create two global fields to hold the recently downloaded dataset file path and the saved model file path:

* `_dataPath` has the path to the dataset used to train the model.
* `_modelPath` has the path where the trained model is saved.

Add the following code to the line right above the `Main` method to specify those paths:

[!code-csharp[Declare global variables](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#DeclareGlobalVariables "Declare global variables")]

You need to create some classes for your input data and predictions. Add a new class to your project:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project, and then select **Add** > **New Item**.

1. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select **Class** and change the **Name** field to *SentimentData.cs*. Then, select the **Add** button.

    The *SentimentData.cs* file opens in the code editor. Add the following `using` statement to the top of *SentimentData.cs*:

[!code-csharp[AddUsings](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/SentimentData.cs#AddUsings "Add necessary usings")]

Remove the existing class definition and add the following code, which has two classes `SentimentData` and `SentimentPrediction`, to the *SentimentData.cs* file:

[!code-csharp[DeclareTypes](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/SentimentData.cs#DeclareTypes "Declare data record types")]

The input dataset class, `SentimentData`, has a `string` for the comment (`SentimentText`) and a `bool` (`Sentiment`) that has a value for sentiment of either positive or negative. Both fields have <xref:Microsoft.ML.Data.LoadColumnAttribute.%23ctor%28System.Int32%29> attributes attached to them. This attribute describes the order of each field in the data file.  In addition, the `Sentiment` property has a <xref:Microsoft.ML.Data.ColumnNameAttribute.%23ctor%2A> to designate it as the `Label` field. `SentimentPrediction` is the class used for prediction after the model has been trained. It has a single boolean (`Sentiment`) and a `PredictedLabel` `ColumnName` attribute. The `Label` is used to create and train the model, and it's also used with the split out test dataset to evaluate the model. The `PredictedLabel` is used during prediction and evaluation. For evaluation, an input with training data, the predicted values, and the model are used.

When building a model with ML.NET you start by creating an <xref:Microsoft.ML.MLContext>. `MLContext` is comparable conceptually to using `DbContext` in Entity Framework. The environment provides a context for your ML job that can be used for exception tracking and logging.

### Initialize variables in Main

Create a variable called `mlContext` and initialize it with a new instance of `MLContext`.  Replace the `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")` line with the following code in the `Main` method:

[!code-csharp[CreateMLContext](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#CreateMLContext "Create the ML Context")]

Add the following as the next line of code in the `Main` method:

[!code-csharp[CallLoadData](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#CallLoadData)]

The `LoadData` method executes the following tasks:

* Loads the data.
* Splits the loaded dataset into train and test datasets.
* Returns the split train and test datasets.

Create the `LoadData` method, just after the `Main` method, using the following code:

```csharp
public static TrainCatalogBase.TrainTestData LoadData(MLContext mlContext)
{

}
```
## Load the data

Since your previously created `SentimentData` data model type matches the dataset schema, you can combine the initialization, mapping, and dataset loading into one line of code using the `MLContext.Data.LoadFromTextFile` wrapper for the [LoadFromTextFile method](xref:Microsoft.ML.TextLoaderSaverCatalog.LoadFromTextFile%60%601%28Microsoft.ML.DataOperationsCatalog,System.String,System.Char,System.Boolean,System.Boolean,System.Boolean,System.Boolean%29). It returns a
<xref:Microsoft.Data.DataView.IDataView>. 

 As the input and output of `Transforms`, a `DataView` is the fundamental data pipeline type, comparable to `IEnumerable` for `LINQ`.

In ML.NET, data is similar to a SQL view. It is lazily evaluated, schematized, and heterogenous. The object is the first part of the pipeline, and loads the data. For this tutorial, it loads a dataset with comments and corresponding toxic or non toxic sentiment. This is used to create the model, and train it.

 Add the following code as the first line of the `LoadData` method:

[!code-csharp[LoadData](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#LoadData "loading dataset")]

### Split the dataset for model training and testing

Next, you need both a training dataset to train the model and a test dataset to evaluate the model. Use the `MLContext.BinaryClassification.TrainTestSplit` which wraps <xref:Microsoft.ML.StaticPipe.TrainingStaticExtensions.TrainTestSplit%2A> to split the loaded dataset into train and test datasets and return them inside of a <xref:Microsoft.ML.TrainCatalogBase.TrainTestData>. You can specify the fraction of data for the test set with the `testFraction`parameter. The default is 10% but you use 20% in this case to use more data for the evaluation.  

To split the loaded data into the needed datasets, add the following code as the next line in the `LoadData` method:

[!code-csharp[SplitData](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#SplitData "Split the Data")]

Return the `splitDataView` at the end of the `LoadData` method:

[!code-csharp[ReturnSplitData](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#ReturnSplitData)]

## Build and train the model

Add the following call to the `BuildAndTrainModel`method as the next line of code in the `Main` method:

[!code-csharp[CallBuildAndTrainModel](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#CallBuildAndTrainModel)]

The `BuildAndTrainModel` method executes the following tasks:

* Extracts and transforms the data.
* Trains the model.
* Predicts sentiment based on test data.
* Returns the model.

Create the `BuildAndTrainModel` method, just after the `Main` method, using the following code:

```csharp
public static ITransformer BuildAndTrainModel(MLContext mlContext, IDataView splitTrainSet)
{

}
```

Notice that two parameters are passed into the Train method; a `MLContext` for the context (`mlContext`), and an `IDataView`for the training dataset (`splitTrainSet`). 

## Extract and transform the data

Pre-processing and cleaning data are important tasks that occur before a dataset is used effectively for machine learning. Raw data is often noisy and unreliable, and may be missing values. Using data without these modeling tasks can produce misleading results.

ML.NET's transform pipelines compose a custom set of transforms that are applied to your data before training or testing. The transforms' primary purpose is data [featurization](../resources/glossary.md#feature-engineering). Machine learning algorithms understand [featurized](../resources/glossary.md#feature) data, so the next step is to transform our textual data into a format that our ML algorithms recognize. That format is a [numeric vector](../resources/glossary.md#numerical-feature-vector).

Next, call `mlContext.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText` which featurizes the text column (`SentimentText`) column into a numeric vector called `Features` used by the machine learning algorithm. This is a wrapper call that returns an <xref:Microsoft.ML.Data.EstimatorChain%601> that will effectively be a pipeline. Name this `pipeline` as you will then append the trainer to the `EstimatorChain`. Add this as the next line of code:

[!code-csharp[FeaturizeText](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#FeaturizeText "Featurize the text")]

>[!WARNING]
> ML.NET Version 0.10 changed the order of the Transform parameters. This will not error out until you run the application and build the model. Use the parameter names for Transforms as illustrated in the previous code snippet.

This is the preprocessing/featurization step. Using additional components available in ML.NET can enable better results with your model.

## Choose a learning algorithm

To add the trainer, call the `mlContext.BinaryClassification.Trainers.FastTree` wrapper method which returns a <xref:Microsoft.ML.Trainers.FastTree.FastTreeBinaryClassificationTrainer> object. This is a decision tree learner you'll use in this pipeline. The `FastTreeBinaryClassificationTrainer` is appended to the `pipeline` and accepts the featurized `SentimentText` (`Features`) and the `Label` input parameters to learn from the historic data.

Add the following code to the `BuildAndTrainModel` method:

[!code-csharp[FastTreeBinaryClassificationTrainer](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#AddTrainer "Add a FastTreeBinaryClassificationTrainer")]

## Train the model

You train the model, <xref:Microsoft.ML.Data.TransformerChain%601>, based on the dataset that has been loaded and transformed. Once the estimator has been defined, you train your model using the <xref:Microsoft.ML.Data.EstimatorChain%601.Fit%2A> method while providing the already loaded training data. This returns a model to use for predictions. `pipeline.Fit()` trains the pipeline and returns a `Transformer` based on the `DataView` passed in. The experiment is not executed until the `.Fit()` method runs.

Add the following code to the `BuildAndTrainModel` method:

[!code-csharp[TrainModel](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#TrainModel "Train the model")]

### Save and Return the model trained to use for evaluation

At this point, you have a model of type <xref:Microsoft.ML.Data.TransformerChain%601> that can be integrated into any of your existing or new .NET applications. Return the model at the end of the `BuildAndTrainModel` method.

[!code-csharp[ReturnModel](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#ReturnModel "Return the model")]

## Evaluate the model

Now that you've created and trained the model, you need to evaluate it with a different dataset for quality assurance and validation. In the `Evaluate` method, the model created in `BuildAndTrainModel` is passed in to be evaluated. Create the `Evaluate` method, just after `BuildAndTrainModel`, as in the following code:

```csharp
public static void Evaluate(MLContext mlContext, ITransformer model, IDataView splitTestSet)
{

}
```

The `Evaluate` method executes the following tasks:

* Loads the test dataset.
* Creates the binaryclassification evaluator.
* Evaluates the model and creates metrics.
* Displays the metrics.

Add a call to the new method from the `Main` method, right under the `Train` method call, using the following code:

[!code-csharp[CallEvaluate](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#CallEvaluate "Call the Evaluate method")]

Next, you'll use the machine learning `model` parameter (a transformer) and the `splitTestSet` parameter to input the features and return predictions. Add the following code to the `Evaluate` method as the next line:

[!code-csharp[PredictWithTransformer](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#TransformData "Predict using the Transformer")]

The `mlContext.BinaryClassification.Evaluate` method computes the quality metrics for the `PredictionModel` using the specified dataset. It returns a <xref:Microsoft.ML.Data.CalibratedBinaryClassificationMetrics> object that contains the overall metrics computed by binary classification evaluators. To display these to determine the quality of the model, you need to get the metrics first. Add the following code as the next line in the `Evaluate` method:

[!code-csharp[ComputeMetrics](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#Evaluate "Compute Metrics")]

### Displaying the metrics for model validation

Use the following code to display the metrics, share the results, and then act on them:

[!code-csharp[DisplayMetrics](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#DisplayMetrics "Display selected metrics")]

To save your model to a .zip file before returning, add the following code to call the `SaveModelAsFile` method as the next line in `Evaluate`:

[!code-csharp[SaveModel](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#CallSaveModel "Save the model")]

## Save the model as a.zip file

Create the `SaveModelAsFile` method, just after the `Evaluate` method, using the following code:

```csharp
private static void SaveModelAsFile(MLContext mlContext, ITransformer model)
{

}
```

The `SaveModelAsFile` method executes the following tasks:

* Saves the model as a .zip file.

Next, create a method to save the model so that it can be reused and consumed in other applications. The `ITransformer` has a <xref:Microsoft.ML.Data.TransformerChain%601.SaveTo(Microsoft.ML.IHostEnvironment,System.IO.Stream)> method that takes in the `_modelPath` global field, and a <xref:System.IO.Stream>. To save this as a zip file, you'll create the `FileStream` immediately before calling the `SaveTo` method. Add the following code to the `SaveModelAsFile` method as the next line:

[!code-csharp[SaveToMethod](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#SaveModel "Add the SaveTo Method")]

You could also display where the file was written by writing a console message with the `_modelPath`, using the following code:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("The model is saved to {0}", _modelPath);
```

## Predict the test data outcome with the saved model

Create the `UseModelWithSingleItem` method, just after the `Evaluate` method, using the following code:

```csharp
private static void UseModelWithSingleItem(MLContext mlContext, ITransformer model)
{

}
```

The `UseModelWithSingleItem` method executes the following tasks:

* Creates a single comment of test data.
* Predicts sentiment based on test data.
* Combines test data and predictions for reporting.
* Displays the predicted results.

Add a call to the new method from the `Main` method, right under the `Evaluate` method call, using the following code:

[!code-csharp[CallUseModelWithSingleItem](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#CallUseModelWithSingleItem "Call the UseModelWithSingleItem method")]

While the `model` is a `transformer` that operates on many rows of data, a very common production scenario is a need for predictions on individual examples. The <xref:Microsoft.ML.PredictionEngine%602> is a wrapper that is returned from the `CreatePredictionEngine` method. Let's add the following code to create the `PredictionEngine` as the first line in the `Predict` Method:

[!code-csharp[CreatePredictionEngine](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#CreatePredictionEngine1 "Create the PredictionEngine")]
  
Add a comment to test the trained model's prediction in the `Predict` method by creating an instance of `SentimentData`:

[!code-csharp[PredictionData](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#CreateTestIssue1 "Create test data for single prediction")]

 You can use that to predict the positive or negative sentiment of a single instance of the comment data. To get a prediction, use <xref:Microsoft.ML.PredictionEngine%602.Predict%2A> on the data. Note that the input data is a string and the model includes the featurization. Your pipeline is in sync during training and prediction. You didn’t have to write preprocessing/featurization code specifically for predictions, and the same API takes care of both batch and one-time predictions.

[!code-csharp[Predict](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#Predict "Create a prediction of sentiment")]

### Use the model: prediction

Display `SentimentText` and corresponding sentiment prediction in order to share the results and act on them accordingly. This is called operationalization, using the returned data as part of the operational policies. Create a display for the results using the following <xref:System.Console.WriteLine?displayProperty=nameWithType> code:

[!code-csharp[OutputPrediction](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#OutputPrediction "Display prediction output")]

## Deploy and Predict with a loaded model

Create the `UseLoadedModelWithBatchItems` method, just before the `SaveModelAsFile` method, using the following code:

```csharp
public static void UseLoadedModelWithBatchItems(MLContext mlContext)
{

}
```

The `UseLoadedModelWithBatchItems` method executes the following tasks:

* Creates batch test data.
* Predicts sentiment based on test data.
* Combines test data and predictions for reporting.
* Displays the predicted results.

Add a call to the new method from the `Main` method, right under the `UseModelWithSingleItem` method call, using the following code:

[!code-csharp[CallPredictModelLoaded](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#CallUseLoadedModelWithBatchItems "Call the CallUseLoadedModelWithBatchItems method")]

Add some comments to test the trained model's predictions in the `UseLoadedModelWithBatchItems` method:

[!code-csharp[PredictionData](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#CreateTestIssues "Create test data for predictions")]

Load the model

[!code-csharp[LoadTheModel](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#LoadModel "Load the model")]

Now that you have a model, you can use that to predict the Toxic or Non Toxic sentiment of the comment data using the <xref:Microsoft.ML.ITransformer.Transform%2A> method. To get a prediction, use `Predict` on new data. Note that the input data is a string and the model includes the featurization. Your pipeline is in sync during training and prediction. You didn’t have to write preprocessing/featurization code specifically for predictions, and the same API takes care of both batch and one-time predictions. Add the following code to the `UseLoadedModelWithBatchItems` method for the predictions:

[!code-csharp[Predict](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#Prediction "Create predictions of sentiments")]

### Use the loaded model for prediction

Display `SentimentText` and corresponding sentiment prediction in order to share the results and act on them accordingly. This is called operationalization, using the returned data as part of the operational policies. Create a header for the results using the following <xref:System.Console.WriteLine?displayProperty=nameWithType> code:

[!code-csharp[OutputHeaders](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#AddInfoMessage "Display prediction outputs")]

Before displaying the predicted results, combine the sentiment and prediction together to see the original comment with its predicted sentiment. The following code uses the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Zip%2A> method to make that happen, so add that code next:

[!code-csharp[BuildTuples](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#BuildSentimentPredictionPairs "Build the pairs of sentiment data and predictions")]

Now that you've combined the `SentimentText` and `Sentiment` into a class, you can display the results using the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine?displayProperty=nameWithType> method:

[!code-csharp[DisplayPredictions](~/samples/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis/Program.cs#DisplayResults "Display the predictions")]

Because inferred tuple element names are a new feature in C# 7.1 and the default language version of the project is C# 7.0, you need to change the language version to C# 7.1 or higher.
To do that, right-click on the project node in **Solution Explorer** and select **Properties**. Select the **Build** tab and select the **Advanced** button. In the dropdown, select  **C# 7.1** (or a higher version). Select the **OK** button.

## Results

Your results should be similar to the following. As the pipeline processes, it displays messages. You may see warnings, or processing messages. These have been removed from the following results for clarity.

Congratulations! You've now successfully built a machine learning model for classifying and predicting messages sentiment. 

Building successful models is an iterative process. This model has initial lower quality as the tutorial uses small datasets to provide quick model training. If you aren't satisfied with the model quality, you can try to improve it by providing larger training datasets or by choosing different training algorithms with different hyper-parameters for each algorithm.
