# Load data from a text file for machine learning processing - ML.NET

`TextLoader` is used to load data from text files. You need to specify the data columns, their types, and their location in the text file.

Note that it's perfectly acceptable to read some columns of a file, or read the same column multiple times.

[Example file](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/test/data/adult.tiny.with-schema.txt):
```
Label	Workclass	education	marital-status
0	Private	11th	Never-married
0	Private	HS-grad	Married-civ-spouse
1	Local-gov	Assoc-acdm	Married-civ-spouse
1	Private	Some-college	Married-civ-spouse
```

To load the data from a text file:

```csharp
// Create a new context for ML.NET operations. It can be used for exception tracking and logging, 
// as a catalog of available operations and as the source of randomness.
var mlContext = new MLContext();
TextLoader textLoader;

// Create the reader: define the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
textLoader = mlContext.Data.TextReader(new TextLoader.Arguments()
{
    Separator = ",",
    HasHeader = true,
    Column = new[]
                {
                    new TextLoader.Column("VendorId", DataKind.Text, 0),
                    new TextLoader.Column("RateCode", DataKind.Text, 1),
                    new TextLoader.Column("PassengerCount", DataKind.R4, 2),
                    new TextLoader.Column("TripTime", DataKind.R4, 3),
                    new TextLoader.Column("TripDistance", DataKind.R4, 4),
                    new TextLoader.Column("PaymentType", DataKind.Text, 5),
                    new TextLoader.Column("FareAmount", DataKind.R4, 6)
                }
}
);

// Now read the file (remember though, readers are lazy, so the reading will happen when the data is accessed).
var data = textLoader.Read(dataPath);
```
