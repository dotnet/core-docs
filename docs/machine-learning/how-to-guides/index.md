# .NET Machine learning how-to guides 

In the How to section of the ML.NET Guide, you can find quick answers to common questions. In some cases, articles may be listed in multiple sections to make them easy to find.

## Load data

* [Load data from files and SQL databases.](load-data-ml-net.md)

### Prepare the data

* [Preprocess training data with normalizers to use in data processing.](normalizers-preprocess-data-ml-net.md)

## Train the model

* [Train a machine learning model with data that's not in a text file.](/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/load-data-ml-net)

* [Train a machine learning model using cross-validation.](train-machine-learning-model-cross-validation-ml-net.md)

* [Train a regression model to predict a value using ML.NET.](train-machine-learning-model-ml-net.md)

### Evaluate the model quality

* [Calculate metrics to evaluate model quality.](verify-model-quality-ml-net.md)

### Model explainability

* [Determine the feature importance of models with Permutation Feature Importance.](explain-machine-learning-model-permutation-feature-importance-ml-net.md)

* [Use Generalized Additive Models and shape functions for model explainability.](use-gams-for-model-explainability.md)

### Feature engineering

* [Apply feature engineering for model training on categorical data.](prepare-data-ml-net.md)

* [Apply feature engineering for model training on textual data with ML.NET.](prepare-data-ml-net.md)

## Run

* [Inspect intermediate data values during ML.NET pipeline processing.](inspect-intermediate-data-ml-net.md)

* [Operationalize a trained machine learning model in apps.](save-load-machine-learning-models-ml-net.md)

* [Use the PredictionFunction to make one prediction at a time.](machine-learning-model-predictions-ml-net.md)

## Probabilistic (Infer.NET)
