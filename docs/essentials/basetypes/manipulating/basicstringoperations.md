# Basic String Operations

Applications often respond to users by constructing messages based on user input. For example, it is not uncommon for Web sites to respond to a newly logged-on user with a specialized greeting that includes the user's name. Several methods in the [System.String](http://dotnet.github.io/api/System.String.html) and [System.Text.StringBuilder](http://dotnet.github.io/api/System.Text.StringBuilder.html) classes allow you to dynamically construct custom strings to display in your user interface. These methods also help you perform a number of basic string operations like creating new strings from arrays of bytes, comparing the values of strings, and modifying existing strings.
