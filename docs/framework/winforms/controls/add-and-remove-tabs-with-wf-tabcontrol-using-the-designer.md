# How to: Add and Remove Tabs with the Windows Forms TabControl Using the Designer
When you place a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl> control on your form, it contains two tabs by default. You can add or remove tabs using the designer.  
  
 The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/42wc9kk5(v=vs.110).aspx) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/zbhkx167.aspx).  
  
### To add or remove a tab using the designer  
  
-   On the control's smart tag, click **Add Tab** or **Remove Tab**  
  
     -or-  
  
     In the **Properties** window, click the **Ellipsis** button (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png "vbEllipsesButton")) next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl.TabPages%2A> property to open the **TabPage Collection Editor**. Click the **Add** or **Remove** button.
