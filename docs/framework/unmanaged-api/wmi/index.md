# Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Performance Counters (Unmanaged API Reference)

The .NET Framework WMI and Performance Counters unmanaged API consists of a set of functions that wrap calls to the [native Windows Management Instrumentation API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa389276(v=vs.85).aspx). It allows you to develop tools and libraries that manage and monitor remote computer systems.

The API includes the following functions:



|Function  | Description  |
|---------|---------|
|[BeginEnumerator](beginernumerator.md) | Begins an enumeration of WMI object properties. |
|Row2     |         |
|Row3     |         |
