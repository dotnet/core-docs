# System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqPoisonMessageRejected
Poison message rejected.  
  
## Description  
 The trace indicates that a poison message was encountered and subsequently rejected. This occurs when the `ReceiveErrorHandling` property on the NetMsmqBinding or MsmqIntegrationBinding is set to `Reject`. A rejected message is delivered back to the senderâ€™s [Dead-Letter Queue](/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-dead-letter-queues-to-handle-message-transfer-failures).  
  
 See [Poison-Message Handling](/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/poison-message-handling) for more details on when messages become poison and how to configure your service to handle them appropriately. See [MQMarkMessageRejected](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/msmq/ms707071(v%3dvs.85)) for more details on what a rejected message means in MSMQ.
