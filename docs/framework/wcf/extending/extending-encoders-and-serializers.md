# Extending Encoders and Serializers
The topics in this section describe how to extend the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] serialization system.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Data Contract Surrogates](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/data-contract-surrogates.md)  
 Describes how serialization, deserialization, schema export, and schema import can be customized using a data contract surrogate class.  
  
 [Custom Message Formatters](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-message-formatters.md)  
 Describes custom message formatters, which can be used to control the serialization and deserialization of a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] message into CLR types.
