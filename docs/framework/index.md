# .NET Framework

.NET Framework is a framework and associated tools that enable developers
to create mobile, desktop, and web applications that run on Windowws PCs,
devices and servers.

This section will be expanded with documentation on Universal Windows
apps, Win32 Desktop apps, and ASP.NET apps. 

This first important part of the story is that you can now run
your .NET Framework applications in [Docker containers on Windows](docker/index.md).
