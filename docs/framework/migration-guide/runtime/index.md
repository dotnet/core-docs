# "Runtime Changes in the .NET Framework | Microsoft Docs"

[!include[introduction](../../../includes/migration-guide/retargeting/introduction.md)]
## Introduction
Runtime changes affect all apps that are running under a .NET Framework it was not compiled against and that use a particular feature.

In the topics that describe runtime changes, we have classified individual items by their expected impact, as follows:

**Major**
This is a significant change that affects a large number of apps or that requires substantial modification of code.

**Minor**
This is a change that affects a small number of apps or that requires minor modification of code.

**Edge case**
This is a change that affects apps under very specific scenarios that are not common.

**Transparent**
This is a change that has no noticeable effect on the app's developer or user. The app should not require modification because of this change.
## Usage
Select the .NET Framework you are currently targeting and then the .NET Framework you wish to migrate to:
