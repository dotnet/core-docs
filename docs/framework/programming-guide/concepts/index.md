This section explains programming concepts in the C# and VB language.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Title|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Assemblies in .NET](../../../standard/assembly/index.md)|Describes how to create and use assemblies.|  
|Asynchronous Programming with async and await in [(C#)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/index.md) or [(Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/async/index.md)|Describes how to write asynchronous solutions by using the async and await keywords. Includes a walkthrough.|  
|Attributes in [(C#)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/attributes/index.md) or [(Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/attributes/index.md)|Discusses how to provide additional information about programming elements such as types, fields, methods, and properties by using attributes.|  
|Caller Information in [(C#)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/caller-information.md) or [(Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/caller-information.md)|Describes how to obtain information about the caller of a method. This information includes the file path and the line number of the source code and the member name of the caller.|  
|Collections in [(C#)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/collections.md) or [(Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/collections.md)|Describes some of the types of collections provided by the .NET Framework. Demonstrates how to use simple collections and collections of key/value pairs.|  
|Covariance and Contravariance in [(C#)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/index.md) or [(Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/index.md)|Shows how to enable implicit conversion of generic type parameters in interfaces and delegates.|  
|Expression Trees in [(C#)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/index.md) or [(Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/index.md)|Explains how you can use expression trees to enable dynamic modification of executable code.|  
|Iterators in [(C#)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/iterators.md) or [(Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/iterators.md)|Describes iterators, which are used to step through collections and return elements one at a time.|  
|Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) in [(C#)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md) or [(Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md)|Discusses the powerful query capabilities in the language syntax and the model for querying relational databases, XML documents, datasets, and in-memory collections.|  
|Object-Oriented Programming in [(C#)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/object-oriented-programming.md) or [(Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/object-oriented-programming.md)|Describes common object-oriented concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.|  
|Reflection in [(C#)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/reflection.md) or [(Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/reflection.md)|Explains how to use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties.|  
|Serialization in [(C#)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/index.md) or [(Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/index.md)|Describes key concepts in binary, XML, and SOAP serialization.|
