# &#39;Microsoft.VisualBasic.ComClassAttribute&#39; is specified for class &#39;&lt;classname&gt;&#39; but it has no public members that can be exposed to COM; therefore no COM interfaces are generated
A class using a `COMClassAttribute` attribute block does not define any `Public` properties or methods. If a class is to be exposed as a COM object, its properties and methods must be declared with `Public` access.  
  
 The message is a warning by default. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40011  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Add the `Public` keyword to one or more properties or methods in the class, or remove the `COMClassAttribute` attribute block.
