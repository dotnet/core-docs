# Reference to a non-shared member requires an object reference
You have referenced a non-shared member within your code and failed to supply an object reference. You cannot use the class name itself to qualify a member that is not shared. The instance must first be declared as an object variable and then referenced by the variable name.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30469  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Declare the instance as an object variable.  
  
2.  Reference the instance by the variable name.
