# Suspend request is pending
In the Visual Studio debugger, an expression specifies a procedure call, but there is a request to suspend the thread.  
  
 The debugger does not attempt to call a procedure on a thread that is not active.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30947  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If possible, determine the source of the request to suspend the thread, so you can prevent it from happening again.  
  
-   Terminate and restart debugging.
