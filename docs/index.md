.NET Documentation
==================

Welcome to .NET! You can build any kind of application you want with .NET, from cloud to mobile to desktop to IoT to games. You can start building your next application today, on Windows, OS X and Linux, in C#, F# or Visual Basic.

* [Console Applications](getting-started/index.md)
  * Cloud worker and utility apps with .NET Core.
* [Web](http://docs.asp.net/)
  * Lean, high-performance, composable and cross-platform web, service and cloud applications with ASP.NET Core.
* [Mobile](http://developer.xamarin.com)
  * Native iOS, Android, and Windows apps using existing skills, teams, and code.
* [Universal Windows Applications](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows)
  * Target the richness of the Universal Windows Platform, for Windows 10.
* [Portable Libraries](getting-started/index.md)
   * Re-use portable libraries across cloud, mobile and desktop apps, including from NuGet.

Try .NET Core
=============

Try out .NET Core. It is the quickest and easiest way to try out .NET, on Windows, macOS or Linux. You can be running .NET Core on your machine in 5 minutes.

Steps here.

Would be awesome to create an animated little wizard that took you through the experience: to guide you through it, or showed you what it looks like if you didn't want to actually do it. Would be good if you built something beyond Hello world with it, maybe QOTD. Would be awesome if you could toggle between the various languages and OSes.

Learning about .NET
===================

You can learn about .NET, how you can use it and what kind of apps you can build with it. 

.NET
----

.NET is a general purpose development platform. It is used for many kinds of apps and workloads. It has several key features that make it easy and efficient to build great applications, including automatic memory management and modern programming languages. .NET enables a high-level programming environment with many convenience features, while providing low-level access to native memory and APIs.

- Learn about [.NET](concepts)
- Learn about C#, F# and Visual Basic (each language needs a link)
- Create portable libraries (link here)
- Browse the [.NET API Library](../../api)
- See great .NET apps and games (link here)
- Participate in the .NET community (link here)

.NET Core
---------

.NET Core is used to build device, web, cloud and embedded/IoT apps. It is [open source](https://github.com/dotnet/core) and cross-platform, supporting Windows, macOS and Linux. [ASP.NET Core](http://docs.asp.net/) is the most popular workload for .NET Core. You can use it to build web apps and services, for on-premises and cloud deployment. You can also use .NET Core to build tools, utilities and cloud worker apps.

Xamarin
-------

Xamarin is used to build native mobile and device apps, primarily for Apple and Google ecosystems. It is [open source](http://open.xamarin.com/). You can use it to build iOS and Android apps for phones, tablets and watches. [Xamarin.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms) is a popular way to write reusable UIs across Apple, Google and Windows apps.

- Learn about [Xamarin](https://developer.xamarin.com/)
- Get started [native mobile apps](https://www.xamarin.com/platform)

.NET Framework
--------------

The .NET Framework is used to build apps for Windows and Windows Server. You can use it to build rich user interfaces with Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) and Windows Forms. You quickly build server apps with ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC and Windows Communication Framework (WCF). It is integrated into Visual Studio, which provides many rich designer experiences for building both client and server apps. It is the best choice for writing apps for Windows.
