# New templates generate top level statements

Starting with the .NET 6 Preview 7 SDK, the console app template generates the following code:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
```

The new output leverages two recent C# features that simplify the code you need to write for a program.  Traditionally, the console template generated the following code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace MyApp // Note: actual namespace depended on the project name.
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Understand the new program

The two features that make the new program simpler are top level statements and global usings.

[Top-level statements](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md) means the compiler generates the namespace, class, and method elements for your main program. You can look at the code for the new application and imagine that it contains the statements inside the `Main` method generated by earlier templates. You can add more statements to the program, just like you can add more statements to your `Main` method in the traditional style. You can even add functions. They are generated as local functions nested inside the generated `Main` method.

Global usings means the compiler imports a set of namespaces based on the project type. For console applications, the following namespaces are imported:

- `System`
- `System.Collections.Generic`
- `System.Linq`
- `System.Net.Http`
- `System.Net.Http.Json`

These namespaces are imported for every source file in the application. Other application types will include additional namespaces that are common for that application type.

Combined, these two features simplify the code that makes up your application. You can concentrate on the code that runs your application.

You can learn more about top level statements in the tutorial exploration on [top level statements](../../csharp/whats-new/tutorials/top-level-statements.md).
