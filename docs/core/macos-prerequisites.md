# Prerequisites for .NET Core on Mac

This article shows you the supported macOS versions and .NET Core dependencies that you need to develop, deploy, and run .NET Core applications on macOS machines. The supported OS versions and dependencies that follow apply to the three ways of developing .NET Core apps on a Mac: via the [command-line with your favorite editor](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/).

## Supported macOS versions

.NET Core is supported by the following versions of macOS:

* macOS 10.12 "Sierra"
* macOS 10.11 "El Capitan"

See the [.NET Core Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/1.1/1.1.md) for the complete list of supported operating systems.

## .NET Core dependencies

Download and install the .NET Core SDK from [.NET Downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core). If you have problems with the installation on macOS, consult the [Known issues & workarounds](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/cli/known-issues.md) topic.

## Visual Studio for Mac

.NET Core development on macOS with Visual Studio for Mac requires:

* A supported version of the macOS operating system
* .NET Core SDK for Mac
* [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/)
