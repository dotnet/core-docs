While installing the .NET Core package, you may see an error similar to `Failed to fetch ... File has unexpected size ... Mirror sync in progress?`. Generally speaking, this error means that the package feed for .NET Core is being upgraded with newer package versions, and that you should try again later. During an upgrade, the package feed should not be unavailable for more than 30 minutes. If you continually receive this error for more than 30 minutes, please file an issue at <https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues>.
