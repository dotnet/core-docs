# What's new in .NET Core 3.0 (Preview 1)

This article describes what is new in .NET Core 3.0 (preview 1). One of the biggest enhancements is support for Windows desktop applications (Windows only). By utilizing a .NET Core 3.0 component called Windows Desktop, you can port your Windows Forms Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications. To be clear, the Windows Desktop component is only supported on Windows. For more information, see the section [Windows desktop](#windows-desktop) below.

.NET Core 3.0 adds support for C# 8.0.

[Download and get started with .NET Core 3 Preview 1](https://aka.ms/netcore3download) right now on Windows, Mac and Linux. You can see complete details of the release in the [.NET Core 3 Preview 1 release notes](https://aka.ms/netcore3releasenotes).

For more information, see the [.NET Core 3.0 Preview 1 announcement](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/12/04/announcing-net-core-3-preview-1-and-open-sourcing-windows-desktop-frameworks/).

## .NET Standard 2.1

.NET Core 3.0 implements .NET Standard 2.1.

## Default executables

.NET Core will now build [framework-dependent executables](../deploying/index.md#framework-dependent-executables-fde) by default. This is new for applications that use a globally installed version of .NET Core. Until now, only [self-contained deployments](../deploying/index.md#self-contained-deployments-scd) would produce an executable.

During `dotnet build` or `dotnet publish`, an executable is created provided that matches the environment and platform of the SDK you are using. You can expect the same things with these executables as you would other native executables, such as:

* You can double-click on the executable.
* You can launch the application from a command prompt directly, such as `myapp.exe` on Windows, and `./myapp` on Linux and macOS.

## Build copies dependencies

`dotnet build` now copies NuGet dependencies for your application from the NuGet cache to the build output folder. Previously, dependencies were only copied as part of `dotnet publish`. 

There are some operations, like linking and razor page publishing that will still require publishing.


## Local dotnet tools

While .NET Core 2.1 supported global tools, .NET Core 3.0 now has local tools. Local tools are similar to global tools but are associated with a particular location on disk. This enables per-project and per-repository tooling. Any tool installed locally isn't available globally.

Local tools rely on a manifest file name `dotnet-tools.json` in your current directory. This manifest file defines the tools to be available. By creating this manifest file at the root of your repository, you ensure anyone cloning your code can restore and use the tools that are needed to successfully work with your code.

When the local tools manifest file is available, use the following command to automatically download and install those tools locally:

```console
dotnet tool restore
```

Run a local tool with the following command:

```console
dotnet tool run <tool-command-name>
```

When a local tool is called, dotnet searches for a manifest up the directory structure. When a tool manifest file is found, it is searched for the requested tool. If the tool is found, it includes the information needed to find the tool in the NuGet global packages location. 

If the tool is found in the manifest, but not the cache, the user receives an error. The message will be improved after Preview 1 to request the user run `dotnet tool restore`.

To add local tools to a directory, you need to first create the tool manifest file. After Preview 1, we will offer a mechanism for creating tool manifest files, such as a dotnet new template. For Preview 1 you must create the file named `dotnet-tools.json` with the following contents:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "isRoot": true,
  "tools": {}
}
```

Once the manifest is created, you can add local tools to it using:

```console
dotnet tool install <toolPackageId>
```

This command installs the latest version of the tool, unless another version is specified.  Even if the latest version was automatically chosen, the version of the tool is written into the tool manifest file to allow the correct version of the tool to be restored or run.

The tool manifest file is designed to allow hand editing â€“ which you might do to update the required version for working with the repository.

Here is an example `dotnet-tools.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "isRoot": true,
  "tools": {
    "dotnetsay": {
      "version": "2.1.4",
      "commands": [
        "dotnetsay"
      ]
    },
    "t-rex": {
      "version": "1.0.103",
      "commands": [
        "t-rex"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To remove a tool from the tool manifest file, run the following command:

```console
dotnet tool uninstall <toolPackageId>
```

For both global and local tools, a compatible version of the runtime is required. Many tools currently on NuGet.org target .NET Core Runtime 2.1. To install those globally or locally, you would still need to install the [NET Core 2.1 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1).

For more information, see [Local Tools Early Preview Documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/10288).

## Windows desktop

Starting with .NET Core 3.0 Preview 1, you can build Windows desktop applications using WPF and Windows Forms. These frameworks also support using modern controls and Fluent styling from the Windows UI XAML Library (WinUI) via [XAML islands](/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/xaml-host-controls).

The Windows Desktop component is part of the Windows .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

You can create a new WPF or Windows Forms app with the following `dotnet` commands:

```console
dotnet new wpf
dotnet new winforms
```

You can also open, launch, and debug .NET Core 3.0 WPF and Windows Forms projects in Visual Studio 2019 Preview 1. It's currently possible to open these projects in Visual Studio 2017 15.9, however, it isn't a supported scenario (and you need to [enable previews](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/11/13/net-core-tooling-update-for-visual-studio-2017-version-15-9/)).

The new projects are the same as existing .NET Core projects, with a couple additions. Here is the comparison of the basic .NET Core console project and a basic Windows Forms and WPF project.

In a .NET Core console project, the project uses the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` SDK and declares a dependency on .NET Core 3.0 via the `netcoreapp3.0` target framework. To create a Windows Desktop app, use the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop` SDK and choose which UI framework to use:

```diff
-<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
+<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework>
+   <UseWPF>true</UseWPF>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

To choose Windows Forms over WPF, set `UseWindowsForms` instead of `UseWPF`:

```diff
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework>
-   <UseWPF>true</UseWPF>
+   <UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Both `UseWPF` and `UseWindowsForms` can be set to `true` if the app uses both frameworks, for example when a Windows Forms dialog is hosting a WPF control.

Please share your feedback on the [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues),  [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) and [dotnet/core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues) repos.

## Fast built-in JSON support

`System.Text.Json.Utf8JsonReader` is a high-performance, low allocation, forward-only reader for UTF-8 encoded JSON text, read from a `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`. The `Utf8JsonReader` is a foundational, low-level type, that can be leveraged to build custom parsers and deserializers. Reading through a JSON payload using the new `Utf8JsonReader` is 2x faster than using the reader from [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json). It does not allocate until you need to actualize JSON tokens as (UTF-16) strings.

This new API will include the following components:

* In Preview 1: JSON reader (sequential access)
* Coming next: JSON writer, DOM (random access), poco serializer, poco deserializer

Here is the basic reader loop for the `Utf8JsonReader` that can be used as a starting point:

```csharp
using System.Text.Json;

public static void Utf8JsonReaderLoop(ReadOnlySpan<byte> dataUtf8)
{
    var json = new Utf8JsonReader(dataUtf8, isFinalBlock: true, state: default);

    while (json.Read())
    {
        JsonTokenType tokenType = json.TokenType;
        ReadOnlySpan<byte> valueSpan = json.ValueSpan;
        switch (tokenType)
        {
            case JsonTokenType.StartObject:
            case JsonTokenType.EndObject:
                break;
            case JsonTokenType.StartArray:
            case JsonTokenType.EndArray:
                break;
            case JsonTokenType.PropertyName:
                break;
            case JsonTokenType.String:
                string valueString = json.GetStringValue();
                break;
            case JsonTokenType.Number:
                if (!json.TryGetInt32Value(out int valueInteger))
                {
                    throw new FormatException();
                }
                break;
            case JsonTokenType.True:
            case JsonTokenType.False:
                bool valueBool = json.GetBooleanValue();
                break;
            case JsonTokenType.Null:
                break;
            default:
                throw new ArgumentException();
        }
    }

    dataUtf8 = dataUtf8.Slice((int)json.BytesConsumed);
    JsonReaderState state = json.CurrentState;
}
```

The .NET ecosystem has relied on [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) and other popular JSON libraries, which continue to be good choices. JSON.NET uses .NET strings as its base datatype, which are UTF-16 under the hood. 

In .NET Core 2.1 and 3.0, we added new APIs that makes it possible to write JSON APIs (such as `Utf8JsonReader`) that require much less memory, based on using `Span<T>` and UTF-8 strings, and better serve the needs of high-throughput applications like Kestrel, ASP.NET Core web server.

## Ranges and indices

The new `Index` type can be used for indexing. You can create one from an `int` that counts from the beginning, or with a prefix `^` operator (C#) that counts from the end:

```csharp
Index i1 = 3;  // number 3 from beginning
Index i2 = ^4; // number 4 from end
int[] a = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
Console.WriteLine($"{a[i1]}, {a[i2]}"); // "3, 6"
```

There is also a `Range` type, which consists of two `Index` values, one for the start and one for the end, and can be written with a `x..y` range expression (C#). You can then index with a `Range` in order to produce a slice:

```csharp
var slice = a[i1..i2]; // { 3, 4, 5 }
```

> [!NOTE]
> Only [C# 8.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/11/12/building-c-8-0/) supports syntax for `Range` and `Index`.

## Async streams

The `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` type is a new asynchronous version of `IEnumerable<T>`. The language lets you `await foreach` over these to consume their elements, and `yield return` to them to produce elements.

The following example demonstrates both production and consumption of async streams. The `foreach` statement is async and itself uses `yield return` to produce an async stream for callers. This pattern (using `yield return`) is the recommended model for producing async streams.

```csharp
async IAsyncEnumerable<int> GetBigResultsAsync()
{
    await foreach (var result in GetResultsAsync())
    {
        if (result > 20) yield return result; 
    }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> .NET Core 3.0 Preview 1 currently has a bug with `await foreach`. Instead, use `GetEnumerator` and `MoveNext` to process elements. For more information, see [roslyn/#31268](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/31268).

In addition to being able to `await foreach`, you can also create async iterators, for example, an iterator that returns an `IAsyncEnumerable/IAsyncEnumerator` that you can both `await` and `yield` in. For objects that need to be disposed, you can use `IAsyncDisposable`, which various BCL types implement, such as `Stream` and `Timer`.

> [!NOTE]
> Only [C# 8.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/11/12/building-c-8-0/) supports `await foreach` syntax.

## Type: SequenceReader

In .NET Core 3.0, `System.Buffers.SequenceReader` has been added which can be used as a reader for `ReadOnlySequence<T>`. This allows easy, high performance, low allocation parsing of `System.IO.Pipelines` data that can cross multiple backing buffers. 

The following example breaks an input `Sequence` into valid `CR/LF` delimited lines:

```csharp
private static ReadOnlySpan<byte> CRLF => new byte[] { (byte)'\r', (byte)'\n' };

public static void ReadLines(ReadOnlySequence<byte> sequence)
{
    SequenceReader<byte> reader = new SequenceReader<byte>(sequence);

    while (!reader.End)
    {
        if (!reader.TryReadToAny(out ReadOnlySpan<byte> line, CRLF, advancePastDelimiter:false))
        {
            // Couldn't find another delimiter
            // ...
        }

        if (!reader.IsNext(CRLF, advancePast: true))
        {
            // Not a good CR/LF pair
            // ...
        }

        // line is valid, process
        ProcessLine(line);
    }
}
```

## Type: MetadataLoadContext

The `MetadataLoadContext` type has been added that enables reading assembly metadata without affecting the callerâ€™s application domain. Assemblies are read as data, including assemblies built for different architectures and platforms than the current runtime environment. `MetadataLoadContext` overlaps with the <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoad*>, which is only available in the .NET Framework.

`MetdataLoadContext` is available in the [System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext). It is a .NET Standard 2.0 package.

The `MetadataLoadContext` exposes APIs similar to the <xref:System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyLoadContext> type, but is not based on that type. Much like <xref:System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyLoadContext>, the `MetadataLoadContext` enables loading assemblies within an isolated assembly loading universe. `MetdataLoadContext` APIs return <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly> objects, enabling the use of familiar reflection APIs. Execution-oriented APIs, such as [MethodBase.Invoke](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext/src/System/Reflection/TypeLoading/Methods/RoMethod.cs#L127), are not allowed and will throw InvalidOperationException.

The following sample demonstrates how to find concrete types in an assembly that implements a given interface:

```csharp
var paths = new string[] {@"C:\myapp\mscorlib.dll", @"C:\myapp\myapp.dll"};
var resolver = new PathAssemblyResolver(paths);
using (var lc = new MetadataLoadContext(resolver))
{
    Assembly a = lc.LoadFromAssemblyName("myapp");
    Type myInterface = a.GetType("MyApp.IPluginInterface");
    foreach (Type t in a.GetTypes())
    {
        if (t.IsClass && myInterface.IsAssignableFrom(t))
            Console.WriteLine($"Class {t.FullName} implements IPluginInterface");
    }
}
```

Scenarios for `MetadataLoadContext` include design-time features, build-time tooling, and runtime light-up features that need to inspect a set of assemblies as data and have all file locks and memory freed after inspection is performed.

The `MetadataLoadContext` has a resolver class passed to its constructor. The resolver's job is to load an `Assembly` given its `AssemblyName`. The resolver class derives from the abstract `MetadataAssemblyResolver` class. An implementation of the resolver for path-based scenarios is provided with `PathAssemblyResolver`.

The [MetadataLoadContext tests](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src/System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext/tests/src/Tests) demonstrate many use cases. The [Assembly tests](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext/tests/src/Tests/Assembly/AssemblyTests.cs) are a good place to start.

## TLS 1.3 & OpenSSL 1.1.1 on Linux

.NET Core will now take advantage of [TLS 1.3 support in OpenSSL 1.1.1](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2018/09/11/release111/), when it is available in a given environment. There are multiple benefits of TLS 1.3, per the [OpenSSL team](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2018/09/11/release111/):

* Improved connection times due to a reduction in the number of round trips required between the client and server.

* Improved security due to the removal of various obsolete and insecure cryptographic algorithms and encryption of more of the connection handshake.

.NET Core 3.0 Preview 1 is capable of utilizing **OpenSSL 1.1.1**, **OpenSSL 1.1.0**, or **OpenSSL 1.0.2** (whatever the best version found is, on a Linux system).  When **OpenSSL 1.1.1** is available the SslStream and HttpClient types will use **TLS 1.3** when using `SslProtocols.None` (system default protocols), assuming both the client and server support **TLS 1.3**.

The following sample demonstrates .NET Core 3.0 Preview 1 on Ubuntu 18.10 connecting to <https://www.cloudflare.com>:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Security;
using System.Net.Sockets;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace tlstest
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main()
        {
            using (TcpClient tcpClient = new TcpClient())
            {
                string targetHost = "www.cloudflare.com";

                await tcpClient.ConnectAsync(targetHost, 443);

                using (SslStream sslStream = new SslStream(tcpClient.GetStream()))
                {
                    await sslStream.AuthenticateAsClientAsync(targetHost);
                    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Connected to {targetHost} with {sslStream.SslProtocol}");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```console
user@comp-ubuntu1810:~/tlstest$ dotnet run
Connected to www.cloudflare.com with Tls13
user@comp-ubuntu1810:~/tlstest$ openssl version
OpenSSL 1.1.1  11 Sep 2018
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Windows and macOS do not yet support **TLS 1.3**. .NET Core 3.0 will support **TLS 1.3** on these operating systems when support becomes available.

## Cryptography

Support has been added for **AES-GCM** and **AES-CCM** ciphers, implemented via `System.Security.Cryptography.AesGcm` and `System.Security.Cryptography.AesCcm`. These algorithms are both [Authenticated Encryption with Association Data (AEAD) algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption), and the first Authenticated Encryption (AE) algorithms added to .NET Core.

The following code demonstrates using **AesGcm** cipher to encrypt and decrypt random data.

The code for **AesCcm** would look almost identical (only the class variable names would be different).

```csharp
// key should be: pre-known, derived, or transported via another channel, such as RSA encryption
byte[] key = new byte[16];
RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(key);

byte[] nonce = new byte[12];
RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(nonce);

// normally this would be your data
byte[] dataToEncrypt = new byte[1234];
byte[] associatedData = new byte[333];
RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(dataToEncrypt);
RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(associatedData);

// these will be filled during the encryption
byte[] tag = new byte[16];
byte[] ciphertext = new byte[dataToEncrypt.Length];

using (AesGcm aesGcm = new AesGcm(key))
{
    aesGcm.Encrypt(nonce, dataToEncrypt, ciphertext, tag, associatedData);
}

// tag, nonce, ciphertext, associatedData should be sent to the other part

byte[] decryptedData = new byte[ciphertext.Length];

using (AesGcm aesGcm = new AesGcm(key))
{
    aesGcm.Decrypt(nonce, ciphertext, tag, decryptedData, associatedData);
}

// do something with the data
// this should always print that data is the same
Console.WriteLine($"AES-GCM: Decrypted data is{(dataToEncrypt.SequenceEqual(decryptedData) ? "the same as" : "different than")} original data.");
```

## Cryptographic Key Import/Export

.NET Core 3.0 Preview 1 supports the import and export of asymmetric public and private keys from standard formats, without needing to use an X.509 certificate.

All key types (RSA, DSA, ECDsa, ECDiffieHellman) support the **X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo** format for public keys, and the **PKCS#8 PrivateKeyInfo** and **PKCS#8 EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo** formats for private keys. RSA additionally supports **PKCS#1 RSAPublicKey** and **PKCS#1 RSAPrivateKey**. The export methods all produce DER-encoded binary data, and the import methods expect the same. If a key is stored in the text-friendly PEM format, the caller will need to base64-decode the content before calling an import method.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

namespace rsakeyprint
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            using (RSA rsa = RSA.Create())
            {
                byte[] keyBytes = File.ReadAllBytes(args[0]);
                rsa.ImportRSAPrivateKey(keyBytes, out int bytesRead);
 
                Console.WriteLine($"Read {bytesRead} bytes, {keyBytes.Length-bytesRead} extra byte(s) in file.");
                RSAParameters rsaParameters = rsa.ExportParameters(true);
                Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(rsaParameters.D));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```

PKCS#8 files can be inspected with the `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs.Pkcs8PrivateKeyInfo` class.

PFX/PKCS#12 files can be inspected and manipulated with `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs.Pkcs12Info` and `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs.Pkcs12Builder`, respectively.

## SerialPort for Linux

.NET Core 3.0 now supports <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort?displayProperty=nameWithType> on Linux.

Previously, .NET Core only supported using the `SerialPort` type on Windows.

## More BCL Improvements

The `Span<T>`, `Memory<T>`, and related types that were introduced in .NET Core 2.1, have been optimized in .NET Core 3.0. Common operations such as span construction, slicing, parsing, and formatting now perform better. 

Additionally, types like `String` have seen under-the-cover improvements to make them more efficient when used as keys with `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` and other collections. No code changes are required to benefit from these improvements.

The following improvements are also new in .NET Core 3 Preview 1:

* Brotli support built in to HttpClient
* ThreadPool.UnsafeQueueWorkItem(IThreadPoolWorkItem)
* Unsafe.Unbox
* CancellationToken.Unregister
* Complex arithmetic operators
* Socket APIs for TCP keep alive
* StringBuilder.GetChunks
* IPEndPoint parsing

## Tiered compilation

[Tiered compilation](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/02/tiered-compilation-preview-in-net-core-2-1/) is on by default with .NET Core 3.0. It is a feature that enables the runtime to more adaptively use the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to get better performance, both at startup and to maximize throughput.

This feature was added as an opt-in feature in [.NET Core 2.1](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/30/announcing-net-core-2-1/) and then was enabled by default in [.NET Core 2.2 Preview 2](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/09/12/announcing-net-core-2-2-preview-2/). Subsequently, it has been reverted back to opt in with the .NET Core 2.2 release.

## ARM64 Linux support

We are adding support for ARM64 for Linux this release. For context, we added support for ARM32 for Linux with .NET Core 2.1 and Windows with .NET Core 2.2. The primary use case for ARM64 is currently with IoT scenarios.

Alpine, Debian and Ubuntu [Docker images are available for .NET Core for ARM64](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/).

Please check [.NET Core ARM64 Status](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/82) for more information.

>[!NOTE]
> **ARM64** Windows support isn't yet available.
