# Trimming Self-Contained Deployments and Executables 

When publishing Self-Contained Deployments (SCD) as well as Self-Contained Executables (SCE), the .NET Core runtime is bundled together with the application. This bundling adds a significant amount of content to your packaged application. 

When it comes to deploying your application, size is often an important factor. Keeping the size of the package application as small as possible is typically a goal for application developers. 

Depending on the complexity of the application, only a subset of the runtime is required to run the application. These unused parts of the runtime are unnecessary and can be trimmed from the packaged application. 

_Note: Trimming is an experimental feature in .NET Core 3.0. This feature is not available for Framework-Dependent Deployments (FDD) and Framework-Dependent Executables (FDE) since they don't include .NET Core assemblies._  

The Trimming feature is available for both Self-Contained Deployments (SCD) and also Self-Contained Executables (SCE), but is not available for Framework-Dependent Deployments (FDD) and Framework-Dependent Executables (FDE) since they don't include .NET Core assemblies.

```dotnetcli
dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=false /p:PublishTrimmed=true
```

_Note: Trimming is an experimental feature in .NET Core 3.0._

The trimming feature works by examining the application binaries to discover and build a graph of the required runtime assemblies. The remaining runtime assemblies that aren't referenced are trimmed.

There are scenarios in which the trimming functionality will fail to detect references. For example, an application that uses reflection could run into this issue because the dependency on the assembly is not known at build time, it is only known at runtime. 

Trimming will only be a problem if the reflection usage adds a dependency on a runtime assembly that is otherwise not referenced directly. Keep in mind that your application code may not be using reflection but a third-party assembly you reference may be using reflection.

When a type is being referenced through reflection, and you don't want that assembly trimmed away by the linker you can provide a hint to the linker by adding the following snippet to your `.proj` file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <TrimmerRootAssembly Include="System.Security" />
</ItemGroup>
```
