# Upgrade Assistant telemetry

The [Upgrade Assistant](xref:upgrade-assistant-overview) includes a telemetry feature that collects usage data. It's important that the Upgrade Assistant team understands how the tool is used so it can be improved.

## How to opt out

The Upgrade Assistant telemetry feature is enabled by default. To opt out of the telemetry feature, set the `DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment variable to `1` or `true`.

## Disclosure

The Upgrade Assistant displays text similar to the following when you first run the tool. Text may vary slightly depending on the version of the tool you're running. This "first run" experience is how Microsoft notifies you about data collection.

```console
Telemetry
---------
The .NET tools collect usage data in order to help us improve your experience. It is collected by Microsoft and shared with the community. You can opt-out of telemetry by setting the DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT environment variable to '1' or 'true' using your favorite shell.
```

To suppress the "first run" experience text, set the `DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE` environment variable to `1` or `true`.

## Data points

The telemetry feature doesn't:

* Collect samples of code

The data is sent securely to Microsoft servers and held under restricted access.
