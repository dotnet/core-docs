# .NET Core breaking changes

The following version and area selectors provide a filtered list of applicable breaking changes between different versions of .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, and EF Core. Instead of using the selectors, you can also browse version to version or category articles in the table of contents.

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms support was added to .NET Core in version 3.0. For breaking changes between .NET Framework and .NET Core for these technologies, see [Breaking changes for WPF and Windows Forms](framework-core.md).

## By version

Select the .NET Core version that you're currently targeting and then the .NET Core version you wish to migrate to:

[!INCLUDE[versionselector](~/includes/core-changes/versionselector.md)]

## By area

Select the .NET Core technology area that you're interested in. Individual changes are ordered by .NET Core version.

[!INCLUDE[categoryselector](~/includes/core-changes/categoryselector.md)]
