# global.json overview

**This article applies to: âœ“** .NET Core 2.x SDK and later versions

The *global.json* file allows you to define which .NET Core SDK version is used when you run .NET Core CLI commands. Selecting the .NET Core SDK is independent from specifying the runtime your project targets. The .NET Core SDK version indicates which versions of the .NET Core CLI tools are used. In general, you want to use the latest version of the tools, so no *global.json* file is needed.

For more information about specifying the runtime instead, see [Target frameworks](../../standard/frameworks.md).

.NET Core SDK looks for a *global.json* file in the current working directory (which isn't necessarily the same as the project directory) or one of its parent directories.

## global.json schema

### sdk

Type: `object`

Specifies information about the .NET Core SDK to select.

#### version

- Type: `string`

- Available since: .NET Core 1.0 SDK.

The version of the .NET Core SDK to use.

Note that this field:

- Doesn't have globbing support, that is, the full version number has to be specified.
- Doesn't support version ranges.

#### allowPrerelease

- Type: `boolean`

- Available since: .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

Indicates whether the SDK resolver should consider prerelease versions when selecting the SDK version to use.

If you don't set this value explicitly, the default value depends on whether you're running from Visual Studio:

- If you're **not** in Visual Studio, the default value is `true`.
- If you are in Visual Studio, it uses the prerelease status requested. That is, if you're using a Preview version of Visual Studio or you set the **Use previews of the .NET Core SDK** option (under **Tools** > **Options** > **Environment** > **Preview Features**), the default value is `true`; otherwise, `false`.

#### rollForward

- Type: `string`

- Available since: .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

The roll-forward policy to use when selecting an SDK version, either as a fallback when a specific SDK version is missing or as a directive to use a later version. You must specify a [version](#version) with a `rollForward` value, unless you're setting it to `latestMajor`. 

To understand the available policies and their behavior, consider the following definitions for a SDK version in the format `x.y.znn`:

- `x` is the major version.
- `y` is the minor version.
- `z` is the feature band.
- `nn` is the patch version.

The following table shows the possible values for the `rollForward` key:

| Value         | Behavior |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| `patch`       | Uses the specified version. <br> If not found, rolls forward to the latest patch level. <br> If not found, fails. <br><br> This is the legacy behavior from the earlier versions of the SDK. |
| `feature`     | Uses the latest patch level for the the specified major, minor, and feature band. <br> If not found, rolls forward to the next available feature band within the same major/minor and uses the latest patch level for that feature band. <br> If not found, fails. |
| `minor`       | Uses the latest patch level for the the specified major, minor, and feature band. <br> If not found, rolls forward to the next available feature band within the same major/minor version and uses the latest patch level for that feature band. <br> If not found, rolls forward to the next available minor and feature band within the same major and uses the latest patch level for that feature band. <br> If not found, fails. |
| `major`       | Uses the latest patch level for the the specified major, minor, and feature band. <br> If not found, rolls forward to the next available feature band within the same major/minor version and uses the latest patch level for that feature band. <br> If not found, rolls forward to the next available minor and feature band within the same major and uses the latest patch level for that feature band. <br> If not found, rolls forward to the next available major, minor, and feature band and uses the latest patch level for that feature band. <br> If not found, fails. |
| `latestPatch` | Uses the latest installed patch level that matches the requested major, minor, and feature band with a patch level and that is greater or equal than the specified value. <br> If not found, fails. |
| `latestFeature` | Uses the latest installed feature band and patch level that matches the requested major and minor with a feature band that is greater or equal than the specified value. <br> If not found, fails. |
| `latestMinor` | Uses the latest installed minor, feature band, and patch level that matches the requested major with a minor that is greater or equal than the specified value. <br> If not found, fails. |
| `latestMajor` | Uses the latest .NET Core SDK available with a major that is greater or equal than the specified value. <br> If not found, fail. |
| `disable`     | Doesn't roll forward. Exact match required. |

## Examples

The following example shows how to not use prerelease versions:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "allowPrerelease": false
  }
}
```

The following example shows how to use the highest version installed that is greater or equal than the specified version:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "3.0.100",
    "rollForward": "latestMajor"
  }
}
```

The following examples how to use the exact specified version:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "3.0.100",
    "rollForward": "disable"
  }
}
```

## global.json and the .NET Core CLI

It's helpful to know which versions are available in order to set one in the *global.json* file. You can find the full list of supported available SDKs at the [Download .NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) page. Starting with .NET Core 2.1 SDK, you can run the following command to verify which SDK versions are already installed on your machine:

```dotnetcli
dotnet --list-sdks
```

To install additional .NET Core SDK versions on your machine, visit the [Download .NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) page.

You can create a new the *global.json* file in the current directory by executing the [dotnet new](dotnet-new.md) command, similar to the following example:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 3.0.100
```

## Matching rules

> [!NOTE]
> The matching rules are governed by the apphost, which is part of the .NET Core runtime.
> The latest version of the host is used when you have multiple runtimes installed side-by-side.

# [.NET Core 3.x](#tab/netcore3x)

Starting with .NET Core 3.0, the following rules apply when determining which version of the SDK to use:

- If no *global.json* file is found, or *global.json* doesn't specify an SDK version nor an `allowPrerelease` value, the latest installed SDK version is used (equivalent to setting `rollForward` to `latestMajor`). Whether the latest SDK version can be release or prerelease depends on how `dotnet` is being invoked.
  - If you're **not** in Visual Studio, prerelease versions are considered.
  - If you are in Visual Studio, it uses the prerelease status requested. That is, if you're using a Preview version of Visual Studio or you set the **Use previews of the .NET Core SDK** option (under **Tools** > **Options** > **Environment** > **Preview Features**), prerelease versions are considered; otherwise, only release versions are considered.
- If a *global.json* file is found that doesn't specify an SDK version but it specifies an `allowPrerelease` value, the latest installed SDK version is used (equivalent to setting `rollForward` to `latestMajor`). Whether the latest SDK version can be release or prerelease depends on the value of `allowPrerelease`. `true` indicates prerelease versions are considered; `false` indicates that only release versions are considered.
- If a *global.json* file is found and it specifies a SDK version:

  - If no `rollFoward` value is set, it uses `major` as the default `rollForward` policy. Otherwise, check each value and their behavior in the [rollForward](#rollforward) section.
  - Whether prerelease versions are considered and what's the default behavior when `allowPrerelease` isn't set is described in the [allowPrerelease](#allowprerelease) section.

# [.NET Core 2.x](#tab/netcore2x)

Starting with .NET Core 2.0, the following rules apply when determining which version of the SDK to use:

- If no *global.json* file is found or *global.json* doesn't specify an SDK version, the latest installed SDK version is used. Latest SDK version can be either release or prerelease - the highest version number wins.
- If *global.json* does specify an SDK version:
  - If the specified SDK version is found on the machine, that exact version is used.
  - If the specified SDK version can't be found on the machine, the latest installed SDK **patch version** of that version is used. Latest installed SDK **patch version** can be either release or prerelease - the highest version number wins. In .NET Core 2.1 and higher, the **patch versions** lower than the **patch version** specified are ignored in the SDK selection.
  - If the specified SDK version and an appropriate SDK **patch version** can't be found, an error is thrown.

The SDK version is composed of the following parts:

`[.NET Core major version].[.NET Core minor version].[xyz][-optional preview name]`

The **feature release** of the .NET Core SDK is represented by the first digit (`x`) in the last portion of the number (`xyz`) for SDK versions 2.1.100 and higher. In general, the .NET Core SDK has a faster release cycle than .NET Core.

The **patch version** is defined by the last two digits (`yz`) in the last portion of the number (`xyz`) for SDK versions 2.1.100 and higher. For example, if you specify `2.1.300` as the SDK version, SDK selection finds up to `2.1.399` but `2.1.400` isn't considered a patch version for `2.1.300`.

.NET Core SDK versions `2.1.100` through `2.1.201` were released during the transition between version number schemes and don't correctly handle the `xyz` notation. We highly recommend if you specify these versions in the *global.json* file, that you ensure the specified versions are on the target machines.

## Troubleshooting build warnings

> [!WARNING]
> You are working with a preview version of the .NET Core SDK. You can define the SDK version via a global.json file in the current project. More at <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=869452>

This warning indicates that your project is being compiled using a preview version of the .NET Core SDK, as explained in the [Matching rules](#matching-rules) section. .NET Core SDK versions have a history and commitment of being high quality. However, if you don't want to use a preview version, add a *global.json* file to your project hierarchy structure to specify which SDK version to use, and use `dotnet --list-sdks` to confirm that the version is installed on your machine. When a new version is released, to use the new version, either remove the *global.json* file or update it to use the newer version.

> [!WARNING]
> Startup project '{startupProject}' targets framework '.NETCoreApp' version '{targetFrameworkVersion}'. This version of the Entity Framework Core .NET Command-line Tools only supports version 2.0 or higher. For information on using older versions of the tools, see <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=871254>

Starting with .NET Core 2.1 SDK (version 2.1.300), the `dotnet ef` command comes included in the SDK. This warning indicates that your project targets EF Core 1.0 or 1.1, which isn't compatible with .NET Core 2.1 SDK and later versions. To compile your project, install .NET Core 2.0 SDK (version 2.1.201) and earlier on your machine and define the desired SDK version using the *global.json* file. For more information about the `dotnet ef` command, see [EF Core .NET Command-line Tools](/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/dotnet).
