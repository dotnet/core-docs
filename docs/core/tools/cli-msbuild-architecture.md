# High-level overview of changes in the .NET Core tools

This document describes the changes associated with moving from *project.json* to MSBuild and the *.csproj* project system that occurred with the release of .NET Core Tools 1.0, .NET Core 1.0.4/1.1.1, and Visual Studio 2017 on March 7, 2017 (see the [Announcement](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/03/07/announcing-net-core-tools-1-0/)). It outlines the new way the tooling is layered all-up and which new pieces are available and what is their place in the overall picture. After reading this article, you should have a better understanding of all of the pieces that make up .NET Core tooling after moving to MSBuild and *.csproj*. 

## Moving away from project.json

The biggest change in the tooling for .NET Core is certainly the [move away from project.json to csproj](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/05/23/changes-to-project-json/) as the project system. The latest versions of the command-line tools don't support *project.json* files. That means that it cannot be used to build, run or publish *project.json* based applications and libraries. In order to use this version of the tools, you need to migrate your existing projects or start new ones. 

As part of this move, the custom build engine that was developed to build *project.json* projects was replaced with a mature and fully capable build engine called [MSBuild](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild). MSBuild is a well-known engine in the .NET community, since it has been a key technology since the platform's first release. Of course because it needs to build .NET Core applications, MSBuild has been ported to .NET Core and can be used on any platform where .NET Core runs. .NET Core holds the promise of a cross-platform development stack, and we've made sure that this move doesn't break that promise.

## The tooling layers

With the move away from the existing project system and with building engine switches, the question that naturally follows is do any of these changes change the overall "layering" of the whole .NET Core tooling ecosystem? Are there new bits and components?

Let's start with a quick refresher on Preview 2 layering as shown in the following picture:

![Preview 2 tools high-level architecture](media/cli-msbuild-architecture/p2-arch.png)

The layering of the tools is quite simple. At the bottom, we have the .NET Core Command Line tools as a foundation. All other higher-level tools, such as Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, depend and rely on the CLI to build projects, restore dependencies, and process other changes to projects. This meant that, for example, if Visual Studio wanted to perform a restore operation, it would call into `dotnet restore` command in the CLI. With the move to the new project system, the previous diagram changes: 

![.NET Core SDK 1.0.0 high-level architecture](media/cli-msbuild-architecture/p3-arch.png)

The main difference is that the CLI is not the foundational layer anymore; this role is now filled by the *shared SDK component*. This shared SDK component is a set of targets and associated tasks that are responsible for compiling your code, publishing it, packing NuGet packages, and other processing. The SDK itself is open-source and is available on GitHub on the [SDK repo](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk). 

> [!NOTE]
> A *target* is a MSBuild term that indicates a named operation that MSBuild can invoke. It's usually coupled with one or more tasks that execute some logic that the target is supposed to perform. MSBuild supports many ready-made targets, such as `Copy` or `Execute`. It also allows users to write their own tasks using managed code and define targets to execute those tasks. For more information, see [MSBuild tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-tasks). 

All the toolsets now consume the shared SDK component and its targets, the CLI included. For example, Visual Studio doesn't call into the `dotnet restore` command to restore dependencies for .NET Core projects, it uses the `Restore` target directly. Since these are MSBuild targets, you can also use raw MSBuild to execute them using the [dotnet msbuild](dotnet-msbuild.md) command. 

### CLI commands

The shared SDK component means that the majority of existing CLI commands are re-implemented as MSBuild tasks and targets. What does this mean for the CLI commands and your usage of the toolset? From an usage perspective, it doesn't change the way you use the CLI. The CLI still has the core commands that you've perhaps used in the past:

* `new`
* `restore`
* `run` 
* `build`
* `publish`
* `test`
* `pack` 

These commands still do what you expect them to do, for example, new up a project, build it, publish it or pack it. The majority of the options haven't changed, and you consult either the commands' help screens (using `dotnet <command> -h|--help`) or documentation on this site to become familiar with changes. 

From an execution perspective, the CLI commands take their parameters and construct a call to *raw* MSBuild that sets the needed properties and runs the desired target. To better illustrate this, consider the following command: 

```console
dotnet publish -o pub -c Release
```
    
This command is publishing an application into a `pub` folder using the Release configuration. Internally, this command gets translated into the following MSBuild invocation: 

```console
dotnet msbuild /t:Publish /p:OutputPath=pub /p:Configuration=Release
```

The notable exception to this rule are `new` and `run` commands, as they haven't been implemented as MSBuild targets.
