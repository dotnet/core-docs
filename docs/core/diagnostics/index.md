This article helps you find the various tools you need.

## [Managed Debuggers](managed-debuggers.md)
Managed debuggers allow you to interact with your program. Debuggers give you insight into the behavior of your code.

## [Logging and Tracing](logging-and-tracing.md)
Logging and tracing are related techniques. They allow instrumenting code to create log files that can be used to diagnose the most complex problems.

## [Unit Testing](../testing/index.md)
Unit testing is a key component of continuous integration and deployment of high-quality software.
