# Tutorial: Debugging a memory leak

**This article applies to: âœ“** .NET Core 3.0 SDK and later versions

This tutorial demonstrates the tools to analyze a .NET Core memory leak.

This tutorial uses a sample app which is designed to intentionally leak memory. The sample is provided as an exerciseOf course you can analyze an app which is unintentionally leaking memory too.

In this tutorial, you will:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Examine managed memory usage with [dotnet-counters](dotnet-counters.md)
> * Generate a dump file
> * Analyze the memory usage using the dump file

## Prerequisites

The tutorial uses:

- .NET Core 3.0 SDK or a later versions
- [dotnet-trace](dotnet-trace.md) to list processes.
- [dotnet-counters](dotnet-counters.md) to check managed memory usage.
- [dotnet-dump](dotnet-dump.md) to collect and analyze a dump file.
- [Sample debug target](sample-debug-target.md) a sample app to diagnose.

The tutorial assumes the sample and tools are installed and ready to use.

## Memory counters

Before you dig into collecting diagnostics data to help us root cause this scenario, you need to convince ourselves that what you are actually seeing is a memory leak (memory growth). You can use the [dotnet-counters](dotnet-counters.md) tool to get at this information.

Lets run the [Sample debug target](sample-debug-target.md).

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

Then find the process ID using:

```console
dotnet-trace ps
```

Before causing the leak, lets check our managed memory counters:

```console
dotnet-counters monitor --refresh-interval 1 -p 4807
```

4807 is the process ID that was found using `dotnet-trace ps`. The refresh-interval is the number of seconds between refreshes.

The output should be similar to:

```console
    Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
      System.Runtime:
        CPU Usage (%)                                  4
        Working Set (MB)                              66
        GC Heap Size (MB)                              4
        Gen 0 GC / second                              0
        Gen 1 GC / second                              0
        Gen 2 GC / second                              0
        Number of Exceptions / sec                     0
```

Here you can see that right after startup, the managed heap memory is 4 MB.

Now, let's hit the URL [http://localhost:5000/api/diagscenario/memleak/200000](http://localhost:5000/api/diagscenario/memleak/200000)

Rerun the dotnet-counters command. You should see an increase in memory usage as shown below:

```console
    Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
      System.Runtime:
        CPU Usage (%)                                  4
        Working Set (MB)                             353
        GC Heap Size (MB)                            258
        Gen 0 GC / second                              0
        Gen 1 GC / second                              0
        Gen 2 GC / second                              0
        Number of Exceptions / sec                     0
```

Memory has now grown to 258 MB.

You can safely say that memory is growing or leaking. The next step is collect the right data for memory analysis.

### Core dump generation

When analyzing possible memory leaks, you need access to the apps memory heap. You then analyze the memory contents. Looking at relationships between objects, you create theories on why memory isn't being freed. A common diagnostics data source is a memory dump (Win) or the equivalent core dump (Linux). To generate a core dump of a .NET Core application, you can use the [dotnet-dump)](dotnet-dump.md) tool.

Using the previous [Sample debug target](sample-debug-target.md) started above, run the following command to generate a core dump:

```dotnetcli
sudo dotnet-dump collect -p 4807
```

4807 is the process ID that can be found using `dotnet-trace ps`. The result is a core dump located in the same folder.

> [!NOTE]
> To generate core dumps, `dotnet-dump` requires sudo.

### Analyzing the core dump

Now that you have a core dump generated, use the [dotnet-dump)](dotnet-dump.md) tool to analyze the dump:

```dotnetcli
dotnet-dump analyze core_20190430_185145
```

Where `core_20190430_185145` is the name of the core dump you want to analyze.

> [!NOTE]
> If you see an error complaining that libdl.so cannot be found, you may have to install the libc6-dev package.

You'll be presented with a prompt where you can enter SOS commands. Commonly, the first thing you want to look at is the overall state of the managed heap:

```console
> dumpheap -stat
```

The (partial) output can be seen below:

Here you can see that you have quite a few strings laying around (also instances of Customer and Customer[]). You can now use the gcroot command on one of the string instances to see how/why the object is rooted:

The string instance appears to be rooted from top-level Processor object which in turn references a cache. You can continue dumping out objects to see how much the cache is holding on to:

From here, you can now try to back-track (from code) why the cache seems to be growing in an unbound fashion.
