# Install .NET Core on Windows

You can install .NET Core on Windows by using the following instructions. We recommend that you start with the .NET Core SDK. The SDK can be used to create, build, test and run .NET Core applications. The .NET Core Runtime is used for running applications, and is typically used for production deployments. In most cases, you will want to download the 64-bit version of either the Runtime or SDK.

You can install .NET Core with an MSI installer or a zip file. The MSI installs .NET Core for all users and adds an entry in your path,while the zip file doesn't.

.NET Core can be installed on the following versions of Windows:

* Windows 7 SP1, 8.1 and Windows 10
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and later
