# Getting started with .NET Core

.NET Core runs on [Windows](windows-prerequisites.md), Linux, and macOS / OS X. Install it on your operating system using the following links:

* [Windows 7 - 10 & Server 2008 - 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows)
* [64-bit Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos)
* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#redhat)
* [Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 & Linux Mint 17](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#ubuntu)
* [Debian 8.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#debian)
* [Fedora 23](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#fedora)
* [CentOS 7.1 & Oracle Linux 7.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#centos)
* [openSUSE 13.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#opensuse)

> See the [Prerequisites for Windows development](windows-prerequisites.md) topic for more details.

> .NET Core isn't yet supported by macOS Sierra, but will be soon.

You can get started developing .NET Core apps by following these step-by-step tutorials:

* [Getting started with .NET Core on Windows, using Visual Studio 2015](tutorials/using-on-windows.md) - Use [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), the full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) for Windows.  
* [Getting started with .NET Core on any platform, using Visual Studio Code](tutorials/using-on-macos.md) - Use [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/), Microsoft's lightweight cross-platform code editor. This tutorial is written for macOS, but Visual Studio Code also works on Windows and Linux.
* [Getting started with .NET Core using the command line](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md) - Use any code editor with the [.NET Core cross-platform command-line interface (CLI)](tools/index.md).
