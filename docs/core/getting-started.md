# Getting started with .NET Core

.NET Core runs on [Windows](#windows), [Linux](#linux), and [macOS / OS X](#os-x--macos).

## Windows

Install .NET Core on [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows). 

You can get started developing .NET Core apps by following these step-by-step tutorials.

* [Getting started with .NET Core on Windows, using Visual Studio 2015](tutorials/using-on-windows.md) - Learn how to use [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), the full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) for Windows, for different .NET Core scenarios.  
* [Get started with Visual Studio Code using C# and .NET Core on Windows](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-with-VS-Code-using-CSharp-and-NET-Core) - This Channel9 video shows you how to install and use [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/code-vs), Microsoft's lightweight cross-platform code editor, to create your first console application in .NET Core.
* [Getting started with .NET Core on macOS, using Visual Studio Code](tutorials/using-on-macos.md) - This tutorial is mainly written for macOS, but you can follow the steps on Windows for a  tour of the steps and workflow to create a .NET Core Solution using VS Code.
* [Getting started with .NET Core using the command-line](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md) - Use any code editor with the [.NET Core cross-platform command-line interface (CLI)](tools/index.md).


See the [Prerequisites for Windows development](windows-prerequisites.md) topic for a list of the supported Windows versions. 

## Linux

Install .NET Core on your distribution/version:

* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#redhat)
* [Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 & Linux Mint 17](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#ubuntu)
* [Debian 8.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#debian)
* [Fedora 23](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#fedora)
* [CentOS 7.1 & Oracle Linux 7.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#centos)
* [openSUSE 13.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#opensuse)

You can get started developing .NET Core apps by following these step-by-step tutorials.

* [Getting started with .NET Core on macOS, using Visual Studio Code](tutorials/using-on-macos.md) - Use [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/code-vs), Microsoft's lightweight cross-platform code editor. This tutorial is written for macOS, but Visual Studio Code also works on Linux. 
* [Getting started with .NET Core using the command-line](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md) - Use any code editor with the [.NET Core cross-platform command-line interface (CLI)](tools/index.md).

.NET Core is supported by the Linux distributions and versions listed above in the installation links.

## OS X / macOS

Install .NET Core for [Mac OS X 10.11](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos).

You can get started developing .NET Core apps by following these step-by-step tutorials.

* [Get started with VS Code using C# and .NET Core on macOS](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-with-VS-Code-using-CSharp-and-NET-Core-on-MacOS) - This Channel9 video shows you how to install and use [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/code-vs), Microsoft's lightweight cross-platform code editor, to create your first console application in .NET Core. 
* [Getting started with .NET Core on macOS, using Visual Studio Code](tutorials/using-on-macos.md) - A tour of the steps and workflow to create a .NET Core Solution using VS Code that includes unit tests, third-party libraries and how to use the debugging tools.
* [Getting started with .NET Core using the command-line](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md) - Use any code editor with the [.NET Core cross-platform command-line interface (CLI)](tools/index.md).

> [!NOTE]
> .NET Core is supported by 64-bit OS X 10.11 (El Capitan). It isn't yet supported by macOS Sierra, but it'll be soon.
