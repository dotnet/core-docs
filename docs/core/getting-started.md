# Getting started with .NET Core

.NET Core runs on [Windows](#windows), [Linux](#linux), and [macOS](#macos)

## Windows

.NET Core is supported by  the following versions of Windows (both 32-bit and 64-bit editions of client operating systems):

* Windows 7 SP1
* Windows 8.1
* Windows 10
* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (Full Server or Server Core)
* Windows Server 2012 SP1 (Full Server or Server Core)
* Windows Server 2012 R2 SP1 (Full Server or Server Core)
* Windows Server 2016 (Full Server, Server Core or Nano Server)

For installation instructions, see [Install for Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows). 

For a getting started tutorial that walks you through development of a simple .NET Core application, choose from the following options:

* [Getting started with .NET Core on Windows, using Visual Studio 2015](tutorials/using-on-windows.md) - Use [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), the full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) for Windows.  
* [Getting started with .NET Core on macOS, using Visual Studio Code](tutorials/using-on-macos.md) - Use [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/code-vs), Microsoft's lightweight cross-platform code editor. Though this tutorial is written primarily for macOS, it includes instructions for Windows wherever usage on Windows differs from macOS.
* [Getting started with .NET Core using the command line](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md) - Use the [.NET Core cross-platform command-line interface (CLI)](tools/index.md).

## Linux

.NET Core is supported by many 64-bit distributions/versions of Linux (click the links for installation instructions):

* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#redhat)
* [Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 & Linux Mint 17](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#ubuntu)
* [Debian 8.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#debian)
* [Fedora 23](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#fedora)
* [CentOS 7.1 & Oracle Linux 7.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#centos)
* [openSUSE 13.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#opensuse)

For a getting started tutorial that walks you through development of a simple .NET Core application, choose from the following options:

* [Getting started with .NET Core on macOS, using Visual Studio Code](tutorials/using-on-macos.md) - Use [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/code-vs), Microsoft's lightweight cross-platform code editor. Though written primarily for macOS, the development procedures are substantially similar on Linux. 
* [Getting started with .NET Core using the command line](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md) - Use the [.NET Core cross-platform command-line interface (CLI)](tools/index.md).

## macOS

.NET Core is supported by 64-bit macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) and above.

For installation instructions, see [Install for Mac OS X 10.11](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos).
