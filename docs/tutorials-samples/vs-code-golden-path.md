# Building simple solutions with Visual Studio Code

By [Toni Solarin](https://github.com/tsolarin)

The scripts in this document describes the steps necessary to build a
number of typical .NET Core solutions, or solutions that include .NET
Core components, using Visual Studio Code. The scenarios include testing,
and using third-party libraries that have not been explicitly built
for the most recent version of .NET Core.

## Prerequisites

These scripts assume that .NET Core CLI (latest RC2 version), and
the .NET Core SDK Preview 1 are installed on the machine. You should
also install Visual Studio Code, and the C# and Omnisharp extensions.

You can find the links to all of these at the [.NET home page](http://dot.net).

### Writing the test project

### Writing the console app

## A mixed .NET Core LIbrary and .NET Framework Application

## Moving a library from netstandard 1.4 to 1.3

## A Mixed PCL library and .NET Framework application

### Writing the library

### Writing the console app
