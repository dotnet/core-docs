About .NET
==========

.NET is a general purpose development platform. It can be used for any kind of app type or workload where general purpose solutions are used. It has several key features that are attractive to many developers, including automatic memory management and modern programming languages, that make it easier to efficiently build high-quality applications. .NET enables a high-level programming environment with many convenience features, while providing low-level access to native memory and APIs.

C#, F# and Visual Basic are popular languages that target and rely on the .NET platform. The .NET languages are known for key features such as their asynchronous programming model, language-integrated query, generic types and type system reflection. The languages also provide great options for both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.

There is great diversity across these languages, in philosophy and syntax, but also symetry provided by a shared type system. This type system is provided by the underlying runtime evironment. .NET was designed around the idea of a "common language runtime" that could support the requirements of diverse languages -- for example, dynamic and statically typed languages -- and enable interoperability between them. For example, it's possible to pass a collection of `People` objects between languages with no loss in semantics or capability.

Multiple [.NET implementations and products](products.md) are available, based on open [.NET Standards](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/dotnet-standards.md) that specify the fundamentals of the platform. They are separately optimized for different application types (e.g. desktop, mobile, gaming, cloud) and support many chips (e.g. x86/x64, ARM) and operating systems (e.g. Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, macOS). Open source is also an important part of the .NET ecosystem, with multiple .NET implementations and many libraries available under OSI-approved licenses.
