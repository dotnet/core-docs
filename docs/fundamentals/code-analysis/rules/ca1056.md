# CA1056: URI properties should not be strings

## Cause

A type declares a string property whose name contains "uri", "Uri", "urn", "Urn", "url", or "Url".

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

This rule splits the property name into tokens based on the Pascal casing convention and checks whether each token equals "uri", "Uri", "urn", "Urn", "url", or "Url". If there is a match, the rule assumes that the property represents a uniform resource identifier (URI). A string representation of a URI is prone to parsing and encoding errors, and can lead to security vulnerabilities. The <xref:System.Uri?displayProperty=fullName> class provides these services in a safe and secure manner.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the property to a <xref:System.Uri> type.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the property does not represent a URI.

## Configurability

You can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca1056.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Configure code analysis rules](../configure-rules.md).

## Example

The following example shows a type, `ErrorProne`, that violates this rule, and a type, `SaferWay`, that satisfies the rule.
