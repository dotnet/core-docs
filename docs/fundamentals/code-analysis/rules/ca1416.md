## Cause

Violations are reported for use of a platform-dependent API in one of the following contexts
- Platform-specific API used in:
  - Platform-neutral context.
  - Different platform context.
- API is unsupported for the current target platform.

This rule is enabled by default only for projects targeting `net5.0` or later. However, you can [enable](#configurability) it for projects targeting other frameworks.

## Rule description

In .NET 5.0 we have added new attributes to annotate platform-specific APIs. This works as follows:
- An unmarked API is considered to work on all OS platforms.
- An API marked with `[SupportedOSPlatform("platformName")]` is considered only portable to the specified OS platforms (the attribute can be applied multiple times with different platforms).
- An API marked with `[UnsupportedOSPlatform("platformName")]` is considered unsupported only to the specified OS platforms (the attribute can be applied multiple times with different platforms).
- Both attributes can be instantiated with or without version numbers as part of the platform name.
- If a combination of `[SupportedOSPlatform] and [UnsupportedOSPlatform]` attributes are present, we group all attributes by OS platform identifier:
  - **Allow list**. If the lowest version for each OS platform is a `[SupportedOSPlatform]` attribute, the API is considered to only be supported by the listed platforms and unsupported by all other platforms. The list could have `[UnsupportedOSPlatform]` attribute with same platform but only with higher version which denotes that the API is removed from that version.
  - **Deny list**. If the lowest version for each OS platform is an `[UnsupportedOSPlatform]` attribute, then the API is considered to only be unsupported by the listed platforms and supported by all other platforms. The list could have `[SupportedOSPlatform]` attribute with same platform but only with higher version which denotes that the API is added support from that version.
  - **Inconsistent list**. If the lowest version for some platforms is `[SupportedOSPlatform]` while it is `[UnsupportedOSPlatform]` for other platforms, is considered inconsistent, and the some annotations on the API are ignored. We plan to introduce another analyzer producing a warning in case of inconsistency in the future.

Accessing an APIs annotated with the above attributes from different platform context could cause following violations.

### Violations
- Accessing an API that is supported only on specified platform (`[SupportedOSPlatform("platformName")]`) from code reachable on other platforms will produce a violation: `'API' is supported on 'platformName'.`

  ```csharp
  // an API supported only on linux
  [SupportedOSPlatform("linux")]
  public void LinuxOnlyApi() { }

  // an API supported on windows and ios from version 14.0
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("ios14.0")]
  public void SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14() { }

  public void Caller()
  {
      LinuxOnlyApi(); // warns CA1416: 'LinuxOnlyApi' is supported on 'linux'

      SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14(); // warns CA1416:'SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14' is supported on 'windows'
                                    // warns CA1416: 'SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14' is supported on 'ios' 14.0 and later
  }

  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > A violation only occurs if the project is not targeting the supported platform (`net5.0-differentPlatform`). This also applies to multi-targeted projects (`net5.0`). No violation occurs if the project is targeting the specified platform (`net5.0-platformName`).

- Accessing an API that is attributed with `[UnsupportedOSPlatform("platformName")]` from the context that targeting the platform with `platformName` could produce a violation: `'API' is unsupported on 'platformName'.`

  ```csharp
  // an API not supported on android but supported on all other
  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("android")]
  public void DoesNotWorkOnAndroid() { }

  // an API was unsupported on windows until version 10.0.1903. The API is considered supported everywhere else without constraints.
  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows10.0.1903")]
  public void StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion();

  public void Caller()
  {
      DoesNotWorkOnAndroid(); // warns CA1416:'DoesNotWorkOnAndroid' is unsupported on 'android'

      StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion(); // warns CA1416:'StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion' is unsupported on 'windows'
                                                 // warns CA1416:'StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion' is supported on 'windows' 10.0.1903 and later
  }
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're building an app that is not targeting the unsupported platform, you won't get any violations. A violation only occurs in the following cases:
  > - If the project is targeting the platform attributed as unsupported or
  > - The `platformName` is included in the default `MSBuild` `<SupportedPlatform>` items group or
  > - Manually including the `platformName` in the MSBuild `<SupportedPlatform>` items group:

  ```XML
  <ItemGroup>
      <SupportedPlatform Include="platformName" />
  </ItemGroup>
  ```

## How to fix violations

The recommended way to deal with these violations is by making sure you only call these APIs when running on the appropriate platforms. You can either achieve this by excluding the code at build time using #if and multi-targeting or by conditionally calling the code at runtime. The analyzer will recognize the new platform guards we added to <xref:System.OperatingSystem> along with traditional <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform%2A?displayProperty=fullName> that you can use for checking.

- Suppress violations by surrounding the call site with the platform guard methods

  ```csharp
  // an API supported only on linux
  [SupportedOSPlatform("linux")]
  public void LinuxOnlyApi() { }

  // an API supported on windows and ios from version 14.0
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("ios14.0")]
  public void SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14() { }

  public void Caller()
  {
      LinuxOnlyApi(); // warns CA1416: 'LinuxOnlyApi' is supported on 'linux'

      SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14(); // warns CA1416:'SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14' is supported on 'windows'
                                    // warns CA1416: 'SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14' is supported on 'ios' 14.0 and later
  }

  // The diagnostics fixed using platform guard methods
  public void Caller()
  {
      if (OperatingSystem.IsLinux())
      {
          LinuxOnlyApi(); // no diagnostic
      }

      if (OperatingSystem.IsIOSVersionAtLeast(14))
      {
          SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14(); // no diagnostic
      }

      if(RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.Windows))
      {
          SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14(); // no diagnostic
      }
  }

  // an API not supported on android but supported on all other
  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("android")]
  public void DoesNotWorkOnAndroid() { }

  // an API was unsupported on windows until version 10.0.1903. The API is considered supported everywhere else without constraints.
  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows10.0.1903")]
  public void StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion();

  public void Caller()
  {
      DoesNotWorkOnAndroid(); // warns CA1416:'DoesNotWorkOnAndroid' is unsupported on 'android'

      StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion(); // warns CA1416:'StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion' is unsupported on 'windows'
                                                 // warns CA1416:'StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion' is supported on 'windows' 10.0.1903 and later
  }

  public void Caller()
  {
      if (!OperatingSystem.IsAndroid())
      {
          DoesNotWorkOnAndroid(); // no diagnostic
      }

      // Can use &&, || logical operators to guard combined attributes
      if (!OperatingSystem.IsWindows() || OperatingSystem.IsWindowsVersionAtLeast(10, 0, 1903))
      {
          StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion(); // no diagnostic
      }
  }

  ```

- The analyzer also respects <xref:System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert%2A?displayProperty=fullName> as a means for preventing the code from being reached on unsupported platforms. Using `Debug.Assert` allows the check to be trimmed out of release builds if desired.

  ```csharp
  // an API supported only on linux
  [SupportedOSPlatform("linux")]
  public void LinuxOnlyApi() { }

  public void Caller()
  {
      Debug.Assert(OperatingSystem.IsLinux());

      LinuxOnlyApi(); // No diagnostic
  }
  ```

- You can choose to mark your own APIs as being platform-specific, thus effectively just forwarding the requirements to your callers. You can apply platform attributes to any of the following:
  - Types
  - Members (methods, fields, properties and events)
  - Assembly

  ```csharp
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("ios14.0")]
  public void SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14() { }

  [SupportedOSPlatform("ios15.0")] // call site version should be equal to or higher than the API version
  public void Caller()
  {
      SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14(); // No diagnostics
  }

  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows10.0.1903")]
  public void StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion();

  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows10.0.1903")]
  public void Caller()
  {
      StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion(); // No diagnostics
  }
  ```

- When an assembly or type level attribute is applied, all members within the assembly or type are considered to be platform specific.

  ```csharp
  [assembly:SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  public namespace ns
  {
      public class Sample
      {
          public void SupportedOnWindows() { }

          public void Caller()
          {
              SupportedOnWindows(); // No diagnostic as call site and calling method both windows only
          }
      }
  }
  ```

## When to suppress warnings

Referencing platform-specific APIs without a proper platform context/guard is not recommended. However, if needed you can suppress these diagnostics by the usual means (`<NoWarn>`, editor config, or #pragma):

```csharp
[SupportedOSPlatform("linux")]
public void LinuxOnlyApi() { }

public void Caller()
{
#pragma warning disable CA1416
    LinuxOnlyApi();
#pragma warning restore CA1416
}
```

## Configurability

The analyzer is enabled by default only for projects targeting `net5.0` or above and has an [AnalysisLevel](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props#analysislevel) of 5 (the default for `net5.0` projects). You can enable it for target frameworks lower than `net5.0`, by adding the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.enable_platform_analyzer_on_pre_net5_target=true
```
