# CA1001: Types that own disposable fields should be disposable

## Cause

A class declares and implements an instance field that is a <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> type and the class does not implement <xref:System.IDisposable>.

## Rule description

A class implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface to dispose of unmanaged resources that it owns. An instance field that is an <xref:System.IDisposable> type indicates that the field owns an unmanaged resource. A class that declares an <xref:System.IDisposable> field indirectly owns an unmanaged resource and should implement the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. If the class does not directly own any unmanaged resources, it should not implement a finalizer.

This rule respects types implementing <xref:System.IAsyncDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> as disposable types.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, implement <xref:System.IDisposable> and from the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the field.

## When to suppress warnings

In general, do not suppress a warning from this rule. It is OK to suppress the warning when the dispose ownership of the field(s) is not held by the containing type.

## Example

The following example shows a class that violates the rule and a class that satisfies the rule by implementing <xref:System.IDisposable>. The class does not implement a finalizer because the class does not directly own any unmanaged resources.
