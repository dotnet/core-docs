# CA1047: Do not declare protected members in sealed types

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1047|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Design|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A public type is `sealed` (`NotInheritable` in Visual basic) and declares a protected member or a protected nested type. This rule does not report violations for <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A> methods, which must follow this pattern.

## Rule description

Types declare protected members so that inheriting types can access or override the member. By definition, you cannot inherit from a sealed type, which means that protected methods on sealed types cannot be called.

The C# compiler issues a warning for this error.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the access level of the member to private, or make the type inheritable.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Leaving the type in its current state can cause maintenance issues and does not provide any benefits.

## Configurability

Starting with version 3.0.0 of the analyzer package, You can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca1047.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Configure code analysis rules](../configure-code-quality-rules.md).

## Example

The following example shows a type that violates this rule.

```csharp
public sealed class SealedClass
{
    protected void ProtectedMethod(){}
}
```

```vb
Public NotInheritable Class BadSealedType
    Protected  Sub MyMethod
    End Sub
End Class
```
