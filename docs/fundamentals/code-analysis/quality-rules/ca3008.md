# CA3008: Review code for XPath injection vulnerabilities

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA3008|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Security|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Potentially untrusted HTTP request input reaches an XPath query.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#include-or-exclude-selected-apis).

## Rule description

When working with untrusted input, be mindful of XPath injection attacks. Constructing XPath queries using untrusted input may allow an attacker to maliciously manipulate the query to return an unintended result, and possibly disclose the contents of the queried XML.

This rule attempts to find input from HTTP requests reaching an XPath expression.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule can't track data across assemblies. For example, if one assembly reads the HTTP request input and then passes it to another assembly that performs an XPath query, this rule won't produce a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a configurable limit to how deep this rule will analyze data flow across method calls. See [Analyzer Configuration](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/master/docs/Analyzer%20Configuration.md#dataflow-analysis) for how to configure the limit in an EditorConfig file.

## How to fix violations

Some approaches to fixing XPath injection vulnerabilities include:

- Don't construct XPath queries from user input.
- Validate that the input only contains a safe set of characters.
- Escape quotation marks.

## When to suppress warnings

If you know you've validated the input to be safe, it's okay to suppress this warning.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options that can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Include or exclude selected APIs

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

#### Excluded symbol names

You can exclude specific symbols, such as types and methods, from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA3008.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings). Each symbol name requires a symbol-kind prefix, such as `M:` for methods, `T:` for types, and `N:` for namespaces.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3008.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3008.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3008.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method `MyMethod` with the specified fully qualified signature. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3008.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

#### Excluded type names with derived types

You can exclude specific types and their derived types from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any methods within types named `MyType` and their derived types, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA3008.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings), with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3008.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType` | Matches all types named 'MyType' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3008.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3008.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type 'MyType' with given fully qualified name and all of its derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3008.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS1.MyType1|M:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' with the respective fully qualified names, and all of their derived types. |

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Xml.XPath;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    public XPathNavigator AuthorizedOperations { get; set; }

    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string operation = Request.Form["operation"];

        // If an attacker uses this for input:
        //     ' or 'a' = 'a
        // Then the XPath query will be:
        //     authorizedOperation[@username = 'anonymous' and @operationName = '' or 'a' = 'a']
        // and it will return any authorizedOperation node.
        XPathNavigator node = AuthorizedOperations.SelectSingleNode(
            "//authorizedOperation[@username = 'anonymous' and @operationName = '" + operation + "']");
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Xml.XPath

Partial Public Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Public Property AuthorizedOperations As XPathNavigator

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
        Dim operation As String = Me.Request.Form("operation")

        ' If an attacker uses this for input:
        '     ' or 'a' = 'a
        ' Then the XPath query will be:
        '      authorizedOperation[@username = 'anonymous' and @operationName = '' or 'a' = 'a']
        ' and it will return any authorizedOperation node.
        Dim node As XPathNavigator = AuthorizedOperations.SelectSingleNode( _
            "//authorizedOperation[@username = 'anonymous' and @operationName = '" + operation + "']")
    End Sub
End Class
```
