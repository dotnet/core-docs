# CA1508: Avoid dead conditional code

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1508|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Maintainability|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-Breaking|

## Cause

A method has conditional code that always evaluates to `true` or `false` at runtime. This leads to dead code in the `false` branch of the condition.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#excluded-symbols).

## Rule description

Methods can have conditional code, such as if statements, binary expressions (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`), null checks, etc. For example, consider the following code:

```csharp
public void M(int i, int j)
{
    if (i != 0)
    {
        return;
    }

    if (j != 0)
    {
        return;
    }

    // Below condition will always evaluate to 'false' as 'i' and 'j' are both '0' here.
    if (i != j)
    {
        // Code in this 'if' branch is dead code.
        // It can either be removed or refactored.
        ...
    }
}
```

C# and VB compilers perform analysis of conditional checks involving compile-time _constant values_ that always evaluate to `true` or `false`. This analyzer performs data flow analysis of non-constant variables to determine redundant conditional checks involving _non-constant values_. In the preceding code, the analyzer determines that `i` and `j` are both `0` for all code paths that reach `i != j` check. Hence, this check will always evaluate to `false` at runtime. The code inside the if statement is dead code and can be removed or refactored. Similarly, the analyzer tracks nullness of variables and reports redundant null checks.

> [!NOTE]
> This analyzer performs an expensive dataflow analysis of non-constant values. This can increase the overall compile time on certain code bases.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the maintainability of your code. It is also fine to suppress violations that are identified to be false positives. These are possible in the presence of concurrent code that can execute from multiple threads.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options that can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Maintainability). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Excluded symbols

#### Excluded symbol names

You can configure which parts of your codebase to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1508.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format). Each symbol name requires a symbol kind prefix, such as "M:" prefix for methods, `T:` prefix for types, "N:" prefix for namespaces, etc.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1508.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1508.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1508.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'MyMethod' with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1508.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

#### Excluded type names with derived types

You can configure which types, including its derived types, to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any methods within types named `MyType` and its derived types, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1508.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format), with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1508.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType` | Matches all types named 'MyType' and all of its derived types in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1508.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' and all of their derived types in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1508.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type 'MyType' with given fully qualified name and all of its derived types
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1508.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS1.MyType1|M:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' with respective fully qualified names and all of their derived types
