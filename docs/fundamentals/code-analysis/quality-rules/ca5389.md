# CA5389: Do not add archive item's path to the target file system path

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5389|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Security|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A non-sanitized source file path is used as the target file path in one of these parameters:

- parameter `destinationFileName` of method <xref:System.IO.Compression.ZipFileExtensions.ExtractToFile%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- parameter `path` of method <xref:System.IO.File.Open%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- parameter `path` of method <xref:System.IO.File.OpenWrite%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- parameter `path` of method <xref:System.IO.File.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- parameter `path` of constructor for <xref:System.IO.FileStream>
- parameter `fileName` of constructor for <xref:System.IO.FileInfo>

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#include-or-exclude-selected-apis).

## Rule description

File path can be relative and can lead to file system access outside of the expected file system target path, leading to malicious config changes and remote code execution via lay-and-wait technique.

## How to fix violations

Do not use the source file path to construct the target file path, or make sure that the last character on the extraction path is the directory separator character.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this warning if the source path always comes from a trusted source.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options that can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Include or exclude selected APIs

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

#### Excluded symbol names

You can exclude specific symbols, such as types and methods, from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5389.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings). Each symbol name requires a symbol-kind prefix, such as `M:` for methods, `T:` for types, and `N:` for namespaces.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5389.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5389.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5389.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method `MyMethod` with the specified fully qualified signature. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5389.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

#### Excluded type names with derived types

You can exclude specific types and their derived types from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any methods within types named `MyType` and their derived types, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5389.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings), with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5389.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType` | Matches all types named 'MyType' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5389.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5389.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type 'MyType' with given fully qualified name and all of its derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5389.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS1.MyType1|M:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' with the respective fully qualified names, and all of their derived types. |

## Example

The following code snippet illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

Violation:

```csharp
using System.IO.Compression;

class TestClass
{
    public void TestMethod(ZipArchiveEntry zipArchiveEntry)
    {
        zipArchiveEntry.ExtractToFile(zipArchiveEntry.FullName);
    }
}
```

Solution:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.IO.Compression;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string zipPath = @".\result.zip";

        Console.WriteLine("Provide path where to extract the zip file:");
        string extractPath = Console.ReadLine();

        // Normalizes the path.
        extractPath = Path.GetFullPath(extractPath);

        // Ensures that the last character on the extraction path
        // is the directory separator char.
        // Without this, a malicious zip file could try to traverse outside of the expected
        // extraction path.
        if (!extractPath.EndsWith(Path.DirectorySeparatorChar.ToString(), StringComparison.Ordinal))
            extractPath += Path.DirectorySeparatorChar;

        using (ZipArchive archive = ZipFile.OpenRead(zipPath))
        {
            foreach (ZipArchiveEntry entry in archive.Entries)
            {
                if (entry.FullName.EndsWith(".txt", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
                {
                    // Gets the full path to ensure that relative segments are removed.
                    string destinationPath = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(extractPath, entry.FullName));

                    // Ordinal match is safest, case-sensitive volumes can be mounted within volumes that
                    // are case-insensitive.
                    if (destinationPath.StartsWith(extractPath, StringComparison.Ordinal))
                        entry.ExtractToFile(destinationPath);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
