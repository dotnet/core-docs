# CA5390: Do not hard-code encryption key

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5390|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Security|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The `key` parameter of the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AesCcm?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AesGcm?displayProperty=fullName> constructor, <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricAlgorithm.Key?displayProperty=fullName> property, or the `rgbKey` parameter of the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricAlgorithm.CreateEncryptor%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricAlgorithm.CreateDecryptor%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is hard-coded by one of the following:

- Byte array.
- <xref:System.Convert.FromBase64String%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.
- All the overloads of <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetBytes%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#include-or-exclude-selected-apis).

## Rule description

For a symmetric algorithm to be successful, the secret key must be known only to the sender and the receiver. When a key is hard-coded, it is easily discovered. Even with compiled binaries, it is easy for malicious users to extract it. Once the private key is compromised, the cipher text can be decrypted directly and is not protected anymore.

## How to fix violations

- Consider redesigning your application to use a secure key management system, such as Azure Key Vault.
- Keep credentials and keys in a secure location separate from your source code.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options that can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Include or exclude selected APIs

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

#### Excluded symbol names

You can exclude specific symbols, such as types and methods, from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5390.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings). Each symbol name requires a symbol-kind prefix, such as `M:` for methods, `T:` for types, and `N:` for namespaces.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5390.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5390.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5390.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method `MyMethod` with the specified fully qualified signature. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5390.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

#### Excluded type names with derived types

You can exclude specific types and their derived types from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any methods within types named `MyType` and their derived types, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5390.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings), with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5390.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType` | Matches all types named 'MyType' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5390.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5390.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type 'MyType' with given fully qualified name and all of its derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5390.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS1.MyType1|M:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' with the respective fully qualified names, and all of their derived types. |

## Pseudo-code examples

### Hard-coded byte array violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(byte[] someOtherBytesForIV)
    {
        byte[] rgbKey = new byte[] {1, 2, 3};
        SymmetricAlgorithm rijn = SymmetricAlgorithm.Create();
        rijn.CreateEncryptor(rgbKey, someOtherBytesForIV);
    }
}
```

### Hard-coded Convert.FromBase64String violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(byte[] someOtherBytesForIV)
    {
        byte[] key = Convert.FromBase64String("AAAAAaazaoensuth");
        SymmetricAlgorithm rijn = SymmetricAlgorithm.Create();
        rijn.CreateEncryptor(key, someOtherBytesForIV);
    }
}
```

### Hard-coded Encoding.GetBytes violation

```csharp
using System.Text;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(byte[] someOtherBytesForIV)
    {
        byte[] key = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("AAAAAaazaoensuth");
        SymmetricAlgorithm rijn = SymmetricAlgorithm.Create();
        rijn.CreateEncryptor(key, someOtherBytesForIV);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Text;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(char[] chars, byte[] someOtherBytesForIV)
    {
        byte[] key = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(chars);
        SymmetricAlgorithm rijn = SymmetricAlgorithm.Create();
        rijn.CreateEncryptor(key, someOtherBytesForIV);
    }
}
```
