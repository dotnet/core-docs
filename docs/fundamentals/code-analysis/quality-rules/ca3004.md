# CA3004: Review code for information disclosure vulnerabilities

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA3004|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Security|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An exception's message, stack trace, or string representation reaches web output.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#include-or-exclude-selected-apis).

## Rule description

Disclosing exception information gives attackers insight into the internals of your application, which can help attackers find other vulnerabilities to exploit.

This rule attempts to find an exception message, stack trace, or string representation being output to an HTTP response.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule can't track data across assemblies. For example, if one assembly catches an exception and then passes it to another assembly that outputs the exception, this rule won't produce a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a configurable limit to how deep this rule will analyze data flow across method calls. For information about how to configure the limit in an EditorConfig file, see [Analyzer Configuration](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/master/docs/Analyzer%20Configuration.md#dataflow-analysis).

## How to fix violations

Don't output exception information to HTTP responses. Instead, provide a generic error message. For more information, see [OWASP's Improper Error Handling page](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).

## When to suppress warnings

If you know your web output is within your application's trust boundary and never exposed outside, it's okay to suppress this warning. This is rare. Take into consideration that your application's trust boundary and data flows may change over time.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options that can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Include or exclude selected APIs

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

#### Excluded symbol names

You can exclude specific symbols, such as types and methods, from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings). Each symbol name requires a symbol-kind prefix, such as `M:` for methods, `T:` for types, and `N:` for namespaces.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method `MyMethod` with the specified fully qualified signature. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with the respective fully qualified signatures. |

#### Excluded type names with derived types

You can exclude specific types and their derived types from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any methods within types named `MyType` and their derived types, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings), with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType` | Matches all types named 'MyType' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type 'MyType' with given fully qualified name and all of its derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS1.MyType1|M:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' with the respective fully qualified names, and all of their derived types. |

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        try
        {
            object o = null;
            o.ToString();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            this.Response.Write(e.ToString());
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Partial Public Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, eventArgs As EventArgs)
        Try
            Dim o As Object = Nothing
            o.ToString()
        Catch e As Exception
            Me.Response.Write(e.ToString())
        End Try
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        try
        {
            object o = null;
            o.ToString();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            this.Response.Write("An error occurred. Please try again later.");
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Partial Public Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, eventArgs As EventArgs)
        Try
            Dim o As Object = Nothing
            o.ToString()
        Catch e As Exception
            Me.Response.Write("An error occurred. Please try again later.")
        End Try
    End Sub
End Class
```
