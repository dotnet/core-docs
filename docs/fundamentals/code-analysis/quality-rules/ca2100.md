# CA2100: Review SQL queries for security vulnerabilities

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2100|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Security|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A method sets the <xref:System.Data.IDbCommand.CommandText%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property by using a string that is built from a string argument to the method.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

This rule assumes that any string, whose value can't be determined at compile time, may contain user input. A SQL command string that is built from user input is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. In a SQL injection attack, a malicious user supplies input that alters the design of a query in an attempt to damage or gain unauthorized access to the underlying database. Typical techniques include injection of a single quotation mark or apostrophe, which is the SQL literal string delimiter; two dashes, which signifies a SQL comment; and a semicolon, which indicates that a new command follows. If user input must be part of the query, use one of the following, listed in order of effectiveness, to reduce the risk of attack.

- Use a stored procedure.

- Use a parameterized command string.

- Validate the user input for both type and content before you build the command string.

The following .NET types implement the <xref:System.Data.IDbCommand.CommandText%2A> property or provide constructors that set the property by using a string argument.

- <xref:System.Data.Odbc.OdbcCommand?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Data.Odbc.OdbcDataAdapter?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbDataAdapter?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Data.OracleClient.OracleCommand?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Data.OracleClient.OracleDataAdapter?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataAdapter?displayProperty=fullName>

In some cases, this rule might not determine a string's value at compile time, even though you can. In those cases, this rule produces false positives when using those strings as SQL commands. The following is an example of such a string.

```csharp
int x = 10;
string query = "SELECT TOP " + x.ToString() + " FROM Table";
```

The same applies when using `ToString()` implicitly.

```csharp
int x = 10;
string query = String.Format("SELECT TOP {0} FROM Table", x);
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use a parameterized query.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the command text does not contain any user input.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options.

### Excluded symbol names

You can configure which parts of your codebase to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA2100.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format). Each symbol name requires a symbol kind prefix, such as "M:" prefix for methods, `T:` prefix for types, "N:" prefix for namespaces, etc.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
|-|-|
| `dotnet_code_quality.CA2100.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType' in the compilation |
| `dotnet_code_quality.CA2100.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1 | MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' in the compilation |
| `dotnet_code_quality.CA2100.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'MyMethod' with given fully qualified signature |
| `dotnet_code_quality.CA2100.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType) | M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature |

You can configure all of these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

## Example

The following example shows a method, `UnsafeQuery`, that violates the rule and a method, `SaferQuery`, that satisfies the rule by using a parameterized command string.
