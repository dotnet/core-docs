# CA5377: Use container level access policy

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5377|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Security|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Container level policy is not set when generating a service Shared Access Signature (SAS).

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#include-or-exclude-selected-apis).

## Rule description

A container-level access policy can be modified or revoked at any time. It provides greater flexibility and control over the permissions that are granted. For more information, see [Define a stored access policy](/rest/api/storageservices/define-stored-access-policy).

## How to fix violations

Specify a valid group policy identifier when generating the service SAS.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress this rule if you're sure that the permissions of all resources are as restricted as possible.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options that can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Include or exclude selected APIs

#### Excluded symbol names

You can exclude specific symbols, such as types and methods, from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5377.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings). Each symbol name requires a symbol-kind prefix, such as `M:` for methods, `T:` for types, and `N:` for namespaces.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5377.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5377.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5377.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method `MyMethod` with the specified fully qualified signature. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5377.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

#### Excluded type names with derived types

You can exclude specific types and their derived types from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any methods within types named `MyType` and their derived types, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5377.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings), with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5377.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType` | Matches all types named 'MyType' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5377.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5377.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type 'MyType' with given fully qualified name and all of its derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5377.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS1.MyType1|M:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' with the respective fully qualified names, and all of their derived types. |

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

At present, the following pseudo-code sample illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(SharedAccessBlobPolicy policy, SharedAccessBlobHeaders headers, Nullable<SharedAccessProtocol> protocols, IPAddressOrRange ipAddressOrRange)
    {
        var cloudAppendBlob = new CloudAppendBlob(null);
        string groupPolicyIdentifier = null;
        cloudAppendBlob.GetSharedAccessSignature(policy, headers, groupPolicyIdentifier, protocols, ipAddressOrRange);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(SharedAccessBlobPolicy policy, SharedAccessBlobHeaders headers, Nullable<SharedAccessProtocol> protocols, IPAddressOrRange ipAddressOrRange)
    {
        CloudAppendBlob cloudAppendBlob = new CloudAppendBlob(null);
        string groupPolicyIdentifier = "123";
        cloudAppendBlob.GetSharedAccessSignature(policy, headers, groupPolicyIdentifier, protocols, ipAddressOrRange);
    }
}
```
