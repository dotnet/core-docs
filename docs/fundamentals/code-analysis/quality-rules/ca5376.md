# CA5376: Use SharedAccessProtocol HttpsOnly

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5376|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Security|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Using the `GetSharedAccessSignature` method under the `Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage` namespace to generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) with specifying `protocols` as `HttpsOrHttp`.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#excluded-symbols).

## Rule description

SAS is a sensitive data which can't be transported in plain text on HTTP.

## How to fix violations

Using `HttpsOnly` when generating SAS.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress this rule.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options that can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Excluded symbols

#### Excluded symbol names

You can configure which parts of your codebase to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5376.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format). Each symbol name requires a symbol kind prefix, such as "M:" prefix for methods, `T:` prefix for types, "N:" prefix for namespaces, etc.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5376.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5376.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5376.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'MyMethod' with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5376.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

#### Excluded type names with derived types

You can configure which types, including its derived types, to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any methods within types named `MyType` and its derived types, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5376.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format), with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5376.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType` | Matches all types named 'MyType' and all of its derived types in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5376.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' and all of their derived types in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5376.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type 'MyType' with given fully qualified name and all of its derived types
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5376.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS1.MyType1|M:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' with respective fully qualified names and all of their derived types

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

At present, the following pseudo-code sample illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.File;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(SharedAccessFilePolicy policy, SharedAccessFileHeaders headers, string groupPolicyIdentifier, IPAddressOrRange ipAddressOrRange)
    {
        CloudFile cloudFile = new CloudFile(null);
        SharedAccessProtocol protocols = SharedAccessProtocol.HttpsOrHttp;
        cloudFile.GetSharedAccessSignature(policy, headers, groupPolicyIdentifier, protocols, ipAddressOrRange);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.File;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(SharedAccessFilePolicy policy, SharedAccessFileHeaders headers, string groupPolicyIdentifier, IPAddressOrRange ipAddressOrRange)
    {
        CloudFile cloudFile = new CloudFile(null);
        SharedAccessProtocol protocols = SharedAccessProtocol.HttpsOnly;
        cloudFile.GetSharedAccessSignature(policy, headers, groupPolicyIdentifier, protocols, ipAddressOrRange);
    }
}
```
