# IL3002: Avoid calling members annotated with 'RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute' when publishing as a single file.

## Cause

When publishing as a single-file (for example, by setting the PublishSingleFile property in a project to true), calling members annotated with the `RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute` attribute might be unsafe, given that members annotated with this attribute require assembly files to be on disk and the assemblies embedded in a single-file are memory loaded.

## How to fix violations

Consider removing the violating call.
