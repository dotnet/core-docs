# CA3001: Review code for SQL injection vulnerabilities

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA3001|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Security|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Potentially untrusted HTTP request input reaches an SQL command's text.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#include-or-exclude-selected-apis).

## Rule description

When working with untrusted input and SQL commands, be mindful of SQL injection attacks. An SQL injection attack can execute malicious SQL commands, compromising the security and integrity of your application. Typical techniques include using a single quotation mark or apostrophe for delimiting literal strings, two dashes for a comment, and a semicolon for the end of a statement. For more information, see [SQL Injection](/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-injection).

This rule attempts to find input from HTTP requests reaching an SQL command's text.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule can't track data across assemblies. For example, if one assembly reads the HTTP request input and then passes it to another assembly that executes the SQL command, this rule won't produce a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a configurable limit to how deep this rule will analyze data flow across method calls. See [Analyzer Configuration](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/master/docs/Analyzer%20Configuration.md#dataflow-analysis) for how to configure the limit in an EditorConfig file.

## How to fix violations

Use parameterized SQL commands, or stored procedures, with parameters containing the untrusted input.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if you know that the input is always validated against a known safe set of characters.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options that can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Include or exclude selected APIs

#### Excluded symbol names

You can exclude specific symbols, such as types and methods, from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA3001.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings). Each symbol name requires a symbol-kind prefix, such as `M:` for methods, `T:` for types, and `N:` for namespaces.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3001.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3001.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3001.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method `MyMethod` with the specified fully qualified signature. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3001.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with the respective fully qualified signatures. |

#### Excluded type names with derived types

You can exclude specific types and their derived types from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any methods within types named `MyType` and their derived types, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA3001.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings), with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3001.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType` | Matches all types named 'MyType' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3001.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3001.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type 'MyType' with given fully qualified name and all of its derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3001.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS1.MyType1|M:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' with the respective fully qualified names, and all of their derived types. |

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

namespace TestNamespace
{
    public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        public static string ConnectionString { get; set; }

        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            string name = Request.Form["product_name"];
            using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
            {
                SqlCommand sqlCommand = new SqlCommand()
                {
                    CommandText = "SELECT ProductId FROM Products WHERE ProductName = '" + name + "'",
                    CommandType = CommandType.Text,
                };

                SqlDataReader reader = sqlCommand.ExecuteReader();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Data
Imports System.Data.SqlClient
Imports System.Linq

Namespace VulnerableWebApp
    Partial Public Class WebForm
        Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

        Public Property ConnectionString As String

        Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
            Dim name As String = Me.Request.Form("product_name")
            Using connection As SqlConnection = New SqlConnection(ConnectionString)
                Dim sqlCommand As SqlCommand = New SqlCommand With {.CommandText = "SELECT ProductId FROM Products WHERE ProductName = '" + name + "'",
                                                                    .CommandType = CommandType.Text}
                Dim reader As SqlDataReader = sqlCommand.ExecuteReader()
            End Using
        End Sub
    End Class
End Namespace
```

### Parameterized solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

namespace TestNamespace
{
    public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        public static string ConnectionString { get; set; }

        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            string name = Request.Form["product_name"];
            using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
            {
                SqlCommand sqlCommand = new SqlCommand()
                {
                    CommandText = "SELECT ProductId FROM Products WHERE ProductName = @productName",
                    CommandType = CommandType.Text,
                };

                sqlCommand.Parameters.Add("@productName", SqlDbType.NVarChar, 128).Value = name;

                SqlDataReader reader = sqlCommand.ExecuteReader();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Data
Imports System.Data.SqlClient
Imports System.Linq

Namespace VulnerableWebApp
    Partial Public Class WebForm
        Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

        Public Property ConnectionString As String

        Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
            Dim name As String = Me.Request.Form("product_name")
            Using connection As SqlConnection = New SqlConnection(ConnectionString)
                Dim sqlCommand As SqlCommand = New SqlCommand With {.CommandText = "SELECT ProductId FROM Products WHERE ProductName = @productName",
                                                                    .CommandType = CommandType.Text}
                sqlCommand.Parameters.Add("@productName", SqlDbType.NVarChar, 128).Value = name
                Dim reader As SqlDataReader = sqlCommand.ExecuteReader()
            End Using
        End Sub
    End Class
End Namespace
```

### Stored procedure solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

namespace TestNamespace
{
    public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        public static string ConnectionString { get; set; }

        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            string name = Request.Form["product_name"];
            using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString))
            {
                SqlCommand sqlCommand = new SqlCommand()
                {
                    CommandText = "sp_GetProductIdFromName",
                    CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure,
                };

                sqlCommand.Parameters.Add("@productName", SqlDbType.NVarChar, 128).Value = name;

                SqlDataReader reader = sqlCommand.ExecuteReader();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
