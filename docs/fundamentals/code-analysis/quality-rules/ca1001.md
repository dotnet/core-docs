# CA1001: Types that own disposable fields should be disposable

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1001|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Design|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking - If the type is not visible outside the assembly.<br/><br/>Breaking - If the type is visible outside the assembly.|

## Cause

A class declares and implements an instance field that is a <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> type and the class does not implement <xref:System.IDisposable>.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#include-or-exclude-selected-apis).

## Rule description

A class implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface to dispose of unmanaged resources that it owns. An instance field that is an <xref:System.IDisposable> type indicates that the field owns an unmanaged resource. A class that declares an <xref:System.IDisposable> field indirectly owns an unmanaged resource and should implement the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. If the class does not directly own any unmanaged resources, it should not implement a finalizer.

This rule respects types implementing <xref:System.IAsyncDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> as disposable types.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, implement <xref:System.IDisposable> and from the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the field.

## When to suppress warnings

In general, do not suppress a warning from this rule. It is OK to suppress the warning when the dispose ownership of the field(s) is not held by the containing type.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options that can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Include or exclude selected APIs

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

#### Excluded symbol names

You can exclude specific symbols, such as types and methods, from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1001.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings). Each symbol name requires a symbol-kind prefix, such as `M:` for methods, `T:` for types, and `N:` for namespaces.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1001.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1001.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1001.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method `MyMethod` with the specified fully qualified signature. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1001.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with the respective fully qualified signatures. |

#### Excluded type names with derived types

You can exclude specific types and their derived types from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any methods within types named `MyType` and their derived types, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1001.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)..
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings), with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1001.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType` | Matches all types named 'MyType' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1001.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1001.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type 'MyType' with given fully qualified name and all of its derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1001.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS1.MyType1|M:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' with the respective fully qualified names, and all of their derived types. |

## Example

The following example shows a class that violates the rule and a class that satisfies the rule by implementing <xref:System.IDisposable>. The class does not implement a finalizer because the class does not directly own any unmanaged resources.
