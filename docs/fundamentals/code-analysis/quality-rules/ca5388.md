# CA5388: Ensure sufficient iteration count when using weak key derivation function

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5388|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Security|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Iteration count may be smaller than 100,000 when deriving cryptographic key by <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#include-or-exclude-selected-apis).

## Rule description

This rule checks if a cryptographic key was generated by <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes> with an iteration count that may be less than 100,000. A higher iteration count can help mitigate against dictionary attacks that try to guess the generated cryptographic key.

This rule is similar to [CA5387](ca5387.md), but analysis can't determine if the iteration count is less than 100,000.

## How to fix violations

Set the iteration count greater than or equal with 100k before calling <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes%2A> explicitly.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress warnings from this rule i:

- You need to use a smaller iteration count for compatibility with existing data.
- You're sure that the iteration count is set above 100,000.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options that can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Include or exclude selected APIs

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

#### Excluded symbol names

You can exclude specific symbols, such as types and methods, from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5388.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings). Each symbol name requires a symbol-kind prefix, such as `M:` for methods, `T:` for types, and `N:` for namespaces.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5388.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5388.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2'. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5388.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method `MyMethod` with the specified fully qualified signature. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5388.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

#### Excluded type names with derived types

You can exclude specific types and their derived types from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any methods within types named `MyType` and their derived types, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5388.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings), with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5388.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType` | Matches all types named 'MyType' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5388.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5388.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type 'MyType' with given fully qualified name and all of its derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5388.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS1.MyType1|M:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types 'MyType1' and 'MyType2' with the respective fully qualified names, and all of their derived types. |

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string password, byte[] salt, int cb)
    {
        var iterations = 100;
        Random r = new Random();

        if (r.Next(6) == 4)
        {
            iterations = 100000;
        }

        var rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt, iterations);
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(cb);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string password, byte[] salt, int cb)
    {
        var rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt);
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.IterationCount = 100000;
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(cb);
    }
}
```
