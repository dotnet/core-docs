# Rule categories

Each code analysis rule belongs to a category of rules. For example, design rules support adherence to the .NET design guidelines, and security rules help prevent security flaws. You can [disable or enable an entire category](../configuration-options.md#scope) of rules. You can also [configure additional options](../code-quality-rule-options.md#category-of-rules) on a per-category basis.

The following table shows the different code analysis rule categories and provides a link to the rules in each category.

| Category | Description |
| - | - |
| [Design rules](design-warnings.md) | Design rules support adherence to the [.NET Framework Design Guidelines](../../../standard/design-guidelines/index.md). |
| [Documentation rules](documentation-warnings.md) | Documentation rules support writing well-documented libraries through the correct use of XML documentation comments for externally visible APIs. |
| [Globalization rules](globalization-warnings.md) | Globalization rules support world-ready libraries and applications. |
| [Portability and interoperability rules](interoperability-warnings.md) | Portability rules support portability across different platforms. Interoperability rules support interaction with COM clients. |
| [Maintainability rules](maintainability-warnings.md) | Maintainability rules support library and application maintenance. |
| [Naming rules](naming-warnings.md) | Naming rules support adherence to the naming conventions of the .NET design guidelines. |
| [Performance rules](performance-warnings.md) | Performance rules support high-performance libraries and applications. |
| [Publish rules](publish-warnings.md) | Publish rules support single-file applications. |
| [Reliability rules](reliability-warnings.md) | Reliability rules support library and application reliability, such as correct memory and thread usage. |
| [Security rules](security-warnings.md) | Security rules support safer libraries and applications. These rules help prevent security flaws in your program. |
| [Style rules](../style-rules/index.md) | Style rules support consistent code style in your codebase. These rules start with the "IDE" prefix. |
| [Usage rules](usage-warnings.md) | Usage rules support proper usage of .NET. |
