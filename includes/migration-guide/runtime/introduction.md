## Introduction

Runtime changes affect all apps that are running under a .NET Framework version that they were not compiled against and that use a particular feature.

In the topics that describe runtime changes, individual items are classified by their expected impact, as follows:

**Major**\
A significant change that affects a large number of apps or that requires substantial modification of code.

**Minor**\
A change that affects a small number of apps or that requires minor modification of code.

**Edge case**\
A change that affects apps under very specific scenarios that are not common.

**Transparent**\
A change that has no noticeable effect on the app's developer or user. The app should not require modification because of this change.
