| Target Frameworks          | Symbol |
| -------------------------- | ------ |
| .NET Framework 2.0-4.7.1   | The preprocessor symbol is formed by adding the .NET Framework version to `NET` without dot (period) notation (for example, .NET Framework 2.0 = `NET20`, .NET Framework 4.7.1 = `NET471`). |
| .NET Standard 1.0-1.6, 2.0 | The preprocessor symbol is formed by adding the .NET Standard version to `NETSTANDARD` with an underscore (`_`) replacing the dot (period) in the version (for example, .NET Standard 1.0 = `NETSTANDARD1_0`, .NET Standard 2.0 = `NETSTANDARD2_0`). |
| .NET Core Application 1.0-1.1, 2.0 | The preprocessor symbol is formed by adding the .NET Core Application version to `NETCOREAPP` with an underscore (`_`) replacing the dot (period) in the version (for example, .NET Core Application 1.0 = `NETCOREAPP1_0`, .NET Core Application 2.0 = `NETCOREAPP2_0`). |
