> [!NOTE]
> The C# examples in this article run in the [Try.NET](https://try.dot.net) inline code runner and playground. Select the **Run** button to run an example in an interactive window. Once you execute the code, you can modify it and run the modified code by selecting **Run** again. The modified code either runs in the interactive window or, if compilation fails, the interactive window displays all C# compiler error messages. 
>  
> The [current culture](xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture) of the [Try.NET](https://try.dot.net) inline code runner and playground is the [invariant culture](xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture). As a result, the output produced by the inline code runner differs from the output displayed by examples that use a default culture as the current culture. 
>
> You can work around this limitation by adding a line of code like the following to set the culture: `System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("en-US");` Just replace `en-US` with the name of the culture that you'd like to be the current culture.
