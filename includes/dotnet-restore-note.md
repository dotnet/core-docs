**Note:** Starting with Dot Net Core 2.0, it is not necessary to run `dotnet restore` becase it is run implicitly as part of `dotnet build` or `dotnet run`. It is still a valid command in certain scenarios where doing an explicit restore makes sense. One example being [continuous integration builds in Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/support/build-deploy-asp-net-core-app-azure/).
