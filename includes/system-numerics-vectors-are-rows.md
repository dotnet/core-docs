The `System.Numerics` namespace represents vectors as rows for vector-matrix multiplication. For this reason, the matrix of the transformation that is composition of transformations *f* and *g* defined by matrices `Mf` and `Mg` respectively is `Mf * Mg` as `(v * Mf) * Mg = v * (Mf * Mg)` for any vector `v`.
