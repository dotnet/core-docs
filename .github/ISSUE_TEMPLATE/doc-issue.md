## Before you enter an issue

If the issue is:

- A simple typo or similar correction, you can submit a PR. See [the contributor guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/#quick-edits-to-existing-documents) for instructions, if needed.
- A general support question rather than a docs issue, consider a forum site instead of a docs issue.
- Related to site design, create an issue at [MicrosoftDocs/Feedback](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Feedback/Issues/new/choose).

If you're struggling with a tutorial, compare your code with the completed sample.
