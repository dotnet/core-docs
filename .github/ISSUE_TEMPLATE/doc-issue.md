**Before you enter an issue**

- If the issue is a simple typo or similar correction, you can just submit a PR. See [the contributor guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/#quick-edits-to-existing-documents) for instructions, if needed.
- If you are are struggling with a tutorial, check your code against the completed sample for differences.
- If the issue is a general support question rather than a docs issue, consider a forum site instead of a docs issue.
- If the issue is relating to site design, create an issue at [MicrosoftDocs/Feedback](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Feedback/Issues/new/choose)

**Include version and OS information**
1. Include the OS you're using.
1. Include the version of .NET you're using. Include "Framework" or "Core" as well.
