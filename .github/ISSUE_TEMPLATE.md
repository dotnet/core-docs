# Issue Title

Be as descriptive as you can with your title. If your issue is requesting
a new topic, please preface the title with [NewTopic].

# General

We use issues to drive the discussion for changes to
existing topics, and the creation of new topics.

This way, we have those discussions before significant
effort is spent writing a new topic. Please see our
[Contributing Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/core-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for details.

## Issues with Existing Topics

Please include a link to the topic. Describe the problem as specifically as you can. Consider:  

- Is content incorrect or outdated?
- Are we missing scenarios for the topic?
- Do we need samples that explain the scenarios?
- Would the explanation be clearer with images?
