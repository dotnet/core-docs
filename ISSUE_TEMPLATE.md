Issue Title
===========

Your issue title is above. Please include the path to the
topic with the issue. For example, if your issue is that
our [list of samples](https://stage.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/samples-and-tutorials/index)
is missing a sample, you'd put [samples-and-tutorials/index.md]
in the issue title.

If your issue is that a topic is missing, please preface
the issue title with [NewTopic]. That helps us find requests
for new topics.

General
=======

We use issues to drive the discussion for changes to
existing topics, and the creation of new topics.

This way, we have those discussions before significant
effort is spent writing a new topic. Please see our
Contributing.md guidelines for details.

Issues with Existing Topics
===========================

Please describe the problem with the current topic. Be as
specific as you can. 

- Is content that you wanted missing?
- Is content incorrect?
- Are links broken?
- Is some content not relevant to the topic?

Requests for new Topics
